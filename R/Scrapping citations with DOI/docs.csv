First, it is a relatively new field that combines public health and practical ethics. Its unfamiliarity requires considerable explanation, yet its scope and emergent qualities make delineation difficult. Moreover, while the early development of public health ethics occurred in a western context, its reach, like public health itself, has become global. A second challenge, then, is to articulate an approach specific enough to provide clear guidance yet sufficiently flexible and encompassing to adapt to global contexts. Broadly speaking, public health ethics helps guide practical decisions affecting population or community health based on scientific evidence and in accordance with accepted values and standards of right and wrong. In these ways, public health ethics builds on its parent disciplines of public health and ethics. This dual inheritance plays out in the definition the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) offers of public health ethics: “A systematic process to clarify, prioritize, and justify possible courses of public health action based on ethical principles, values and beliefs of stakeholders, and scientific and other information” (CDC 2011). Public health ethics shares with other fields of practical and professional ethics both the general theories of ethics and a common store of ethical principles, values, and beliefs. It differs from these other fields largely in the nature of challenges that public health officials typically encounter and in the ethical frameworks it employs to address these challenges. Frameworks provide methodical approaches or procedures that tailor general ethical theories, principles, values, and beliefs to the specific ethical challenges that arise in a particular field. Although no framework is definitive, many are useful, and some are especially effective in particular contexts. This chapter will conclude by setting forth a straightforward, stepwise ethics framework that provides a tool for analyzing the cases in this volume and, more importantly, one that public health practitioners have found useful in a range of contexts. For a public health practitioner, knowing how to employ an ethics framework to address a range of ethical challenges in public health—a know-how that depends on practice—is the ultimate take-home message.","2016","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-13 17:31:03","","","","","","","Public Health Ethics","","","","","Springer","Cham (CH)","eng","Copyright 2016, The Author(s).","","","","PubMed","NBK435780","PMID: 28590692","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\PNRSBAYU\NBK435780.html; ","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28590692","","","H.

However, little is known about what types of evidence policymakers working in local settings prefer to use. This study aims to evaluate policymakers' needs and sources of information, at regional and local levels. Methods: An electronic survey with telephone follow-up was carried out among PH policymakers and evidence producers (n = 152) working in a large UK city. Respondents were asked which types of evidence they used regularly, found most useful and what were their main sources of information. Semi-structured interviews (n = 23) added were analysed quantitatively in addition to the categorical data generated by the survey. Results: Policymakers use a much greater range of evidence and information than is often indicated in the literature on evidence-based policy. Local data were by far the most used (n = 95%) and most valued (n =85%) type of information, followed by practice guidelines. The main sources of information were Government websites (84%), followed by information obtained through personal contacts (71%), including PH professionals, council officers and politicians. Academics were rarely consulted and research evidence was rarely seen as directly relevant. Conclusions: Policymakers use a wider range of evidence types than previously discussed in the literature. Although local data were most valued by policymakers, results suggest that these were accessed through personal contacts, rather than specialized organizations. Systems to provide local high-quality evidence for PH policy should be supported.","2017-05-02","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-13 16:50:26","112-117","","","27","","EUR J PUBLIC HEALTH","Defining 'evidence' in public health","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\E4ZN6M4E\Oliver et de Vocht - 2017 - Defining 'evidence' in public health a survey of .pdf; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\8INLPVWJ\display.html","","","Public Health; Decision Making; Health Policy; Human; Public Figures; Surveys; United Kingdom; Urban Areas -- United Kingdom","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Escalating costs of care and increasing poverty have brought urgency to professional training to improve efficiency, cut costs and maintain gains in life expectancy and morbidity reduction. Technology, genetics research and designer drugs have dramatically changed medical practice. Creatively, educational institutions have adopted the use of: (1) New educational and communication technologies: internet and health informatics; (2) Problem based learning approaches; Integrated Practice and Theory Curricula; Research and Problem Solving methodologies and (3) Partnership and networking of institutions to synergise new trends (e.g. core competencies). Less desirably, changes are inadequate in key areas, e.g., Health Economics, Poverty and Health Development, Disaster Management & Bioterrorism and Ethics. Institutions have begun to adjust and develop new programs of study to meet challenges of emerging diseases, design methodologies to better understand complex social and economic determinants of disease, assess the effects of violence and address cost containment strategies in health. Besides redesigning instruction, professional schools need to conduct research to assess the impact of health reform. Such studies will serve as sentinels for the public's health, and provide key indicators for improvements in training, service provision and policy.","2002","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","35-39","","1","14","","Asia Pac J Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 12597516","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12597516","","Humans; Global Health; Public Health; Schools, Public Health; Asia; Curriculum; Education, Medical; Health Care Reform; Internationality; Medical Informatics; Organizational Innovation; Schools, Medical; Social Change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the rise of modern epidemiology has been a mixed blessing, and the new paradigm has major shortcomings, both in public health and scientific terms. The changes in the paradigm have not been neutral but have rather helped change- and have reflected changes in-the way in which epidemiologists think about health and disease. The key issue has been the shift in the level of analysis from the population to the individual. Epidemiology has largely ceased to function as part of a multidisciplinary approach to understanding the causation of disease in populations and has become a set of generic methods for measuring associations of exposure and disease in individuals. This reductionist approach focuses on the individual, blames the victim, and produces interventions that can be harmful. We seem to be using more and more advanced technology to study more and more trivial issues, while the major causes of disease are ignored. Epidemiology must reintegrate itself into public health and must rediscover the population perspective.","1997","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","92-99","","2","21","","Epidemiol Prev","","","","","","","","ita","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9378189","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9378189","","Humans; Public Health; Disease; Epidemiologic Methods; Epidemiology; Goals; Population Surveillance; Risk Factors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The incidence is generally less than 10 per 100000 (the highest incidence is in children), with regional variations and a marked seasonality. Laboratory selection criteria and reporting have contributed to, but cannot entirely explain, variations within and between countries. Surveillance data and outbreaks in definable cohorts indicate that the spectrum of illness ranges from diarrhoea through acute bloody diarrhoea, with about 5% of cases developing haemolytic uraemic syndrome; less than 50% of patients report frank blood in their stools. Studies of sporadic cases have associated illness with beef products (particularly if undercooked and eaten outside the home), cooked sliced meat meals and contact with a household member with diarrhoea. Outbreaks have been attributed to contaminated foods (including beefburgers) and water, animal contact and person-to-person spread. Secondary transmission by the primary case in a household is of particular concern, and household transmission has been estimated at 4%, with patients excreting for around 10 days following onset. Recommendations for control have highlighted measures on farms, in slaughterhouses, retail and catering food premises, and in the home.","2000","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","1S-9S","","29","","","Symp Ser Soc Appl Microbiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10880174","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10880174","","Aged; Female; Humans; United Kingdom; Population Surveillance; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Escherichia coli Infections; Escherichia coli O157; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Seasons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The fact remains, however, that, at this point, its true potential is largely unrealized. Canada has played a significant role in the development of health promotion internationally through cosponsorship of the First International Conference on Health Promotion in 1986, which produced the Ottawa Charter, and nationally through the release of Achieving Health for All: A Framework for Health Promotion in the same year. I review the background of health promotion from an international perspective, but I focus on the Canadian experience.

METHODS: This scoping review searched federal and P/T websites on daily COVID-19 pandemic preparedness strategies between 30 January and 30 April 2020. The PROGRESS-Plus equity-lens framework was used to define priority populations. All definitions, policies and guidelines of PH strategies implemented by the federal and P/T governments to reduce risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission were included. PH measures were classified using a modified Public Health Agency of Canada Framework for Canadian Pandemic Influenza Preparedness. RESULTS: A total of 722 COVID-19 PH measures were issued during the study period. Of these, home quarantine (voluntary) (n=13.0%; 94/722) and retail/commerce restrictions (10.9%; n=79/722) were the most common measures introduced. Many of the PH orders, including physical distancing, cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures or retail/commerce restrictions began to be introduced after 11 March 2020. Lifting of some of the PH orders in phases to reopen the economy began in April 2020 (6.5%; n=47/722). The majority (68%, n=491/722) of COVID-19 PH announcements were deemed mandatory, while 32% (n=231/722) were recommendations. Several PH measures (28.0%, n=202/722) targeted a variety of groups at risk of socially produced health inequalities, such as age, religion, occupation and migration status. CONCLUSIONS: Most PH measures centred on limiting contact between people who were not from the same household. PH measures were evolutionary in nature, reflecting new evidence that emerged throughout the pandemic. Although ~30% of all implemented COVID-19 PH measures were tailored towards priority groups, there were still unintended consequences on these populations.","2021-03-09","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","e046177","","3","11","","BMJ Open","Public health measures to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33687956 PMCID: PMC7944419","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\SV7W9USW\Polisena et al. - 2021 - Public health measures to reduce the risk of SARS-.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33687956","","Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Canada; Communicable Disease Control; Crowding; health policy; infection control; Physical Distancing; public health; Quarantine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The first scope is to know the returns of all resources allocated, although the scope is wider as it also pretends, in the long-run, to orient process in itself and its funding schemes and priorities with the objective of assessing the social returns, epidemiological, health services and public health, and of contributing to the existing experience knowledge in this field of disciplines. With this scope, the present document overviews the open challenges, and proposes an adapted framework and highlights methodological issues for further applications. Burden of disease, variability in clinical practice, and the cost-effectiveness of healthcare interventions are among the most common criteria used to evaluate the relevance of research topics. Other aspects that are usually considered but which are more difficult to quantify include the existence of social inequalities in health, social and environmental situation, between others. Although it is agreed that explicit criteria should be used to prioritize funding, no standard method is currently used. It is required a framework that included concepts pertaining to organizational system dynamics, as well as social (e.g. well-being) and economic value, in addition to measures of traditional scientific impact. The objectives of this study were to (i) identify new criteria for priority-setting in health service topics; (ii) develop a composite priority score; and (iii) evaluate the reliability and validity of the final priority score.

However, the cost and complexity of CxCa screening and treatment approaches has hampered scale-up, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and new approaches are needed. Therapeutic HPV vaccines (TxV), which could clear persistent high-risk HPV infection and/or cause regression of pre-cancerous lesions, are in early clinical development and might offer one such approach. During October 2021 to March 2022, WHO, in collaboration with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, convened a series of global expert consultations to lay the groundwork for understanding the potential value of TxV in the context of current CxCa prevention efforts and for defining WHO preferred product characteristics (PPCs) for TxV. WHO PPCs describe preferences for vaccine attributes that would help optimize vaccine value and use in meeting the global public health need. This paper reports on the main discussion points and findings from the expert consultations. Experts identified several ways in which TxV might address challenges in current CxCa prevention programmes, but emphasized that the potential value of TxV will depend on their degree of efficacy and how quickly they can be developed and implemented relative to ongoing scale-up of existing interventions. Consultation participants also discussed potential use-cases for TxV, important PPC considerations (e.g., vaccine indications, target populations, and delivery strategies), and critical modelling needs for predicting TxV impact and cost-effectiveness.","2022-09-29","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","5843-5855","","41","40","","Vaccine","Understanding the public health value and defining preferred product characteristics for therapeutic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36008233","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\PMRWNZYA\Prudden et al. - 2022 - Understanding the public health value and defining.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36008233","","Female; Humans; Public Health; Adolescent; World Health Organization; Alphapapillomavirus; Cervical cancer; Early Detection of Cancer; HPV; Papillomaviridae; Papillomavirus Infections; Papillomavirus Vaccines; Preferred product characteristics; Referral and Consultation; Therapeutic HPV vaccine; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, despite the ubiquitous nature of CS within public health research and practice, there has been surprisingly little attention given to defining CS or delineating a framework for developing culturally sensitive programs and practitioners. This paper describes a model for understanding CS from a public health perspective; describes a process for applying this model in the development of health promotion and disease prevention interventions; and highlights research priorities. Cultural sensitivity is defined by two dimensions: surface and deep structures. Surface structure involves matching intervention materials and messages to observable, ""superficial"" characteristics of a target population. This may involve using people, places, language, music, food, locations, and clothing familiar to, and preferred by, the target audience. Surface structure refers to how well interventions fit within a specific culture. Deep structure involves incorporating the cultural, social, historical, environmental and psychological forces that influence the target health behavior in the proposed target population. Whereas surface structure generally increases the ""receptivity"" or ""acceptance"" of messages, deep structure conveys salience. Techniques, borrowed from social marketing and health communication theory, for developing culturally sensitive interventions are described. Research is needed to determine the effectiveness of culturally sensitive programs.","1999","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 23:17:52","","10-21","","1","9","","Ethn Dis","Cultural sensitivity in public health","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10355471","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10355471","","Humans; Health Priorities; Health Promotion; Primary Prevention; Black or African American; Cultural Diversity; Focus Groups; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Models, Organizational; Needs Assessment; Program Development; Program Evaluation; Public Health Practice; Research; White People","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Five electronic publication databases were searched to define, describe, or categorize PHI and discuss tropical cyclone, flood, storm, tornado, and tsunami-related disasters and their impact on PHI. The data were analyzed through aggregation of individual articles to create an overall data description. The data were grouped into PHI themes, which were then prioritized on the basis of degree of interdependency. RESULTS: Sixty-seven relevant articles were identified. PHI was categorized into 13 themes with a total of 158 descriptors. The highest priority PHI identified was workforce. This was followed by water, sanitation, equipment, communication, physical structure, power, governance, prevention, supplies, service, transport, and surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified workforce as the most important of the 13 thematic areas related to PHI and disasters. If its functionality fails, workforce has the greatest impact on the performance of health services. If addressed post-disaster, the remaining forms of PHI will then be progressively addressed. These findings are a step toward providing an evidence base to inform PHI priorities in the disaster setting.

Such research draws on a range of clinical and non-clinical data to make predictions about health risks, such as identifying epidemics and monitoring disease spread. Much of this research uses data from social media in the public domain or anonymous secondary health data and is therefore exempt from ethics committee scrutiny. While the ethical use and regulation of digital-based research has been discussed, little attention has been given to the ethics governance of such research in higher education institutions in the field of population health. Such governance is essential to how scholars make ethical decisions and provides assurance to the public that researchers are acting ethically. We propose a process of ethics governance for population health research in higher education institutions. The approach takes the form of review after the research has been completed, with particular focus on the role artificial intelligence algorithms play in augmenting decision-making. The first layer of review could be national, open-science repositories for open-source algorithms and affiliated data or information which are developed during research. The second layer would be a sector-specific validation of the research processes and algorithms by a committee of academics and stakeholders with a wide range of expertise across disciplines. The committee could be created as an off-shoot of an already functioning national oversight body or health technology assessment organization. We use case studies of good practice to explore how this process might operate.","2020-04-01","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","239-244","","4","98","","Bull World Health Organ","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32284646 PMCID: PMC7133469","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\FHNJFPVK\Samuel et Derrick - 2020 - Defining ethical standards for the application of .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32284646","","Population Health; Artificial Intelligence; Ethics, Research","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This lack of correspondence between impact and power is related in part to its scarce recognition as a profession, and in consequence to the lack of recognition of the professionals in the field. The strengthening of the public health profession requires recognising the coherence of their objectives and scientific basis, but it also requires the establishment of mechanisms to guarantee professional competence. Generally, the institutionalisation of these necessary mechanisms to articulate public health objectives into effective professional practice has been lacking. In other words, the so-called professional competencies lacked development in public health. Progress in this strategy calls for the definition of the professional content based on a functional analysis of public health. That is, an analysis of the functions that these professionals must contribute to society and of the specific activities necessary to achieve the desired outcomes. The aim of this work is to stimulate a debate along these lines taking into account the experiences of other countries. The authors propose to reconsider a further reconstruction of public health, based on an analysis of its objectives, functions and competences, in order to grow away from its marginal position, and improve its social function.","2003","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","23-34","","","17 Suppl 3","","Gac Sanit","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 14980184","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14980184","","Public Health; United States; Clinical Competence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It also discusses the limitations of the existing literature and identifies areas in need of future research. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Studies included in this review were retrieved through an iterative process, primarily through key word searches in two literature databases (PubMed and JSTOR) conducted in 2013. All retrieved studies underwent initial and secondary screening. Articles were included if they (1) examined the link between spending and outcomes or (2) explored pathways that mediate the relationship between spending and outcomes. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Seventeen empirical studies and five literature reviews published between 1985 and 2012 were included in this review. Existing evidence suggests that increases in public health spending are associated with improved population health, at least for some outcomes. However, there is little evidence to suggest that increased spending contributes to meaningful reductions in health disparities. Moreover, the pathways through which greater spending translates into better outcomes are not well understood. CONCLUSIONS: Although the complexity of the public health delivery system makes it difficult to demonstrate definitive associations between spending and outcomes, financial investments in public health have the potential to improve community health. Additional research is needed to explore the pathways that mediate this relationship. This research would benefit public health practitioners who need evidence on how to best spend financial resources to achieve better health outcomes.","2014-11","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","634-640","","5","47","","Am J Prev Med","Public health spending and population health","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25084684","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25084684","","Humans; Public Health; Health Expenditures; Health Status; Health Status Disparities","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

U.S. children's hospitals also undertake population health programs, but less is known about how they define population health. The purpose of this study is to understand how U.S. children's hospitals define population health, and how institutions are adjusting to new preventive health care models. METHODS: We conducted semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders at ten hospitals with the highest amount of staff time dedicated to population health activities as reported in the 2016 Children's Hospital Association's population health survey. Using a semi-structured interview guide, we interviewed representatives from each hospital. Verbatim interview notes were coded and analyzed using the data analysis software Dedoose. Data analysis followed a modified constructivist grounded theory approach. RESULTS: Our results suggest that even population health innovators employ a variety of approaches that span both population health management and public health. We present further evidence that U.S. children's hospitals are actively debating the definition and focus of population health. CONCLUSIONS: Definitional debates are ongoing even within children's hospitals that are dedicating significant resources to population health. Increased clarity on the conceptual boundaries between population health and population health management could help preserve the theoretical differences between the two concepts, especially insofar as they mark two quite different long-term visions for health care. Without agreement about the meaning of population health within and among institutions, hospitals will not be able to know whether projects aimed at addressing the social determinants of health are likely to improve the health of populations.","2018-06-26","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","494","","1","18","","BMC Health Serv Res","How U.S. children's hospitals define population health","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29940946 PMCID: PMC6019316","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\ZGCMNZ3E\Skinner et al. - 2018 - How U.S. children's hospitals define population he.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29940946","","Female; Humans; Health Services Research; Population Health; United States; Child; Male; Children’s hospitals; Community benefit; Databases, Factual; Hospitals; Hospitals, Pediatric; Interviews as Topic; Population health; Population health management; Qualitative Research; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Records; Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although its importance is increasingly recognised, there is no consensus about the definition of health literacy or about its conceptual dimensions, which limits the possibilities for measurement and comparison. The aim of the study is to review definitions and models on health literacy to develop an integrated definition and conceptual model capturing the most comprehensive evidence-based dimensions of health literacy. METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed to identify definitions and conceptual frameworks of health literacy. A content analysis of the definitions and conceptual frameworks was carried out to identify the central dimensions of health literacy and develop an integrated model. RESULTS: The review resulted in 17 definitions of health literacy and 12 conceptual models. Based on the content analysis, an integrative conceptual model was developed containing 12 dimensions referring to the knowledge, motivation and competencies of accessing, understanding, appraising and applying health-related information within the healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion setting, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based upon this review, a model is proposed integrating medical and public health views of health literacy. The model can serve as a basis for developing health literacy enhancing interventions and provide a conceptual basis for the development and validation of measurement tools, capturing the different dimensions of health literacy within the healthcare, disease prevention and health promotion settings.","2012-01-25","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","80","","","12","","BMC Public Health","Health literacy and public health","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22276600 PMCID: PMC3292515","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\W5I8UNLQ\Sørensen et al. - 2012 - Health literacy and public health a systematic re.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22276600","","Humans; Public Health; Terminology as Topic; Concept Formation; Health Literacy; Models, Theoretical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regardless of the cause of the food risk, adulteration of food is both an industry and a government responsibility. Food safety, food fraud, and food defense incidents can create adulteration of food with public health threats. Food fraud is an intentional act for economic gain, whereas a food safety incident is an unintentional act with unintentional harm, and a food defense incident is an intentional act with intentional harm. Economically motivated adulteration may be just that-economically motivated-but the food-related public health risks are often more risky than traditional food safety threats because the contaminants are unconventional. Current intervention systems are not designed to look for a near infinite number of potential contaminants. The authors developed the core concepts reported here following comprehensive research of articles and reports, expert elicitation, and an extensive peer review. The intent of this research paper is to provide a base reference document for defining food fraud-it focuses specifically on the public health threat-and to facilitate a shift in focus from intervention to prevention. This will subsequently provide a framework for future quantitative or innovative research. The fraud opportunity is deconstructed using the criminology and behavioral science applications of the crime triangle and the chemistry of the crime. The research provides a food risk matrix and identifies food fraud incident types. This project provides a starting point for future food science, food safety, and food defense research. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Food fraud, including the more defined subcategory of economically motivated adulteration, is a food protection threat that has not been defined or holistically addressed. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led to the development of food defense as an autonomous area of study and a new food protection discipline. As economically motivated adulteration grows in scope, scale, and awareness, it is conceivable that food fraud will achieve the same status as an autonomous concept, between food safety and food defense. This research establishes a starting point for defining food fraud and identifying the public health risks.","2011","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","R157-163","","9","76","","J Food Sci","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22416717","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22416717","","Risk Factors; Consumer Product Safety; Food Safety; Fraud; Risk Assessment; Terrorism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although they are potentially very important in the current health workforce context, there is little agreement on their roles or the most suitable methods to define these roles. METHOD: Based on a review of literature, existing role descriptions and focus groups, a Delphi survey process was undertaken. This process comprising three rounds of discussion and clarification via email, with between 107 and 188 participants, was undertaken to define and establish consensus on allied health assistant roles at three levels. RESULTS: Three cycles of editing, qualitative feedback and rating of agreement with statements resulted in substantial clarification of roles and a meaningful degree of consensus regarding the role and scope of such positions. High levels of agreement were not reached for more high-level or contested clinical tasks. CONCLUSIONS: The Delphi process resulted in key tasks and roles being defined and contentious aspects clearly identified. The process facilitated engagement with workforce members most closely affected by these questions. It was a useful means of drawing together the opinions of the workforce and informing implementation trials to follow.","2013-11","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","602-606","","5","37","","Aust Health Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24176133","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\G6IZ6QJ5\Stute et al. - 2013 - Defining the role and scope of practice of allied .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24176133","","Humans; Public Health Practice; Allied Health Personnel; Consensus; Delphi Technique; Queensland; Role","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A postal survey to all adults ≥50 years of age registered with eight general practices in the UK. Self-reported data on chronic joint pain in four body regions (hand, hip, knee, foot) and the disabling nature of the pain was collected to determine gender and age-group specific prevalence estimates of clinical OA in the joint region and in the person. Multiple imputation and weighted logistic regression was used to allow for missing data. RESULTS: A total of 26 705 mailed surveys resulted in 18 474 responses (adjusted response = 71.8%). Approximately half of the mailed population had OA in at least one of the four regions (53.23%, 95% CI 52.3, 54.1) and less than half of these had disabling OA (21.87%, 95% CI 21.2, 22.5). The more joint regions involved, the more likely that the OA was disabling. OA prevalence was higher in females and increased with age. Applied to the population of England, this yielded an estimated 3.5 million persons with disabling OA, including 1.45 million people between 50 and 65 years of age and 370 000 ≥85 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: A simple approach to defining the person with OA can contribute to population comparisons, public health projections and health care needs assessments.","2014-02","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","338-345","","2","53","","Rheumatology (Oxford)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24173433 PMCID: PMC3894672","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\NFHGNAJ2\Thomas et al. - 2014 - Defining and mapping the person with osteoarthriti.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24173433","","Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Public Health; United Kingdom; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; epidemiology; Arthralgia; Community Health Planning; Foot Joints; Hand Joints; Health Surveys; Hip Joint; Knee Joint; osteoarthritis; Osteoarthritis; prevalence; Prevalence; service planning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet health is primarily a product of our social, cultural, and physical environments.

Simultaneously, there is increasing interest in getting ""upstream"" from disease management to promote health and prevent disease. Hence, the term ""population health"" has both clinical and community-based connotations relevant to the tripartite mission of US medical schools.Objective: To seek broad input for the strategic development of the Department of Population Health in a new medical school at a tier 1 research university.Design: Focus groups with facilitated consensus development.Participants: Eighty-one persons representing the Dell Medical School and other schools at the University of Texas at Austin, city/county government, community nonprofit organizations, and faculty from other local university schools along with selected national academic leaders.Approach: Focus groups with subsequent consensus development of emphases identified premeeting by participants by e-mail exchanges.Key Results: The resulting departmental strategic plan included scope of work, desired characteristics of leaders, and early impact activities in seven areas of interest: community engagement and health equity, primary care and value-based health, occupational and environment medicine, medical education, health services and community-based research, health informatics and data analysis, and global health.Conclusions: Medical schools should have a primary focus in population, most effectively at the departmental level.

We examine the nature and source of these social responsibilities, discuss a debate in the epidemiological literature on roles and responsibilities, and cite approaches to environmental justice as reflective of them. At one level, responsibility refers to accountability, as in being responsible for actions taken. A deeper meaning of responsibility corresponds to commitment to the pursuit and achievement of a valued end. Epidemiologists are committed to the scientific study of health and disease in human populations and to the application of scientific knowledge to improve the public's health. Responsibility is also closely linked to reliability. Responsible professionals reliably perform the tasks they set for themselves as well as the tasks society expects them to undertake. The defining axiom for our approach is that the health of the public is a social good we commit ourselves to pursue, thus assuming an obligation to contribute to its achievement. Epidemiologists cannot claim to be committed to public health as a social good and not accept the responsibility of ensuring that the knowledge gained in their roles as scientists is used to achieve that good. The social responsibilities of environmental health researchers are conspicuous in the environmental justice movement, for example, in community-based participatory research. Responsibility is an ethical concept particularly well suited to frame many key aspects of the ethics of our profession.","2003-11","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","1804-1808","","14","111","","Environ Health Perspect","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 14602514 PMCID: PMC1241728","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\34PGUJ9C\Weed et McKeown - 2003 - Science and social responsibility in public health.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14602514","","Humans; Health Care and Public Health; Public Health; Epidemiology; Biomedical and Behavioral Research; Environment; Ethics, Professional; Science; Social Responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the aim of this systematic review was to identify and explore research which has defined and enumerated public health workforces. In particular, how were such workforces defined? Who was included in these workforces? And how did researchers make judgments about the size of a workforce? In this systematic review, we identified 82 publications which enumerated a public health workforce between 2000 and November 2018. Most workforce definitions were unique and study-specific and included workers based on their occupation or their place of work. Common occupations included public health nurses and physicians, epidemiologists, and community health workers. National workforces varied by size, with the United States and Switzerland having the largest public health workforces per-capita, although definitions used varied substantially. Normative assessments (e.g., assessments of ideal workforce size) were informed through opinion, benchmarks or ""service-target"" models. There are very few regular, consistent enumerations within countries, and fewer still which capture a substantial proportion of the public heath workforce. Assessing the size of the public health workforce is often overlooked and would be aided by fit-for-purpose data, alignment of occupations and functions to international standards, and transparency in normative methods.","2020","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","588092","","","8","","Front Public Health","No Two Workforces Are the Same","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33330331 PMCID: PMC7711128","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\KU35FUD9\Watts et al. - 2020 - No Two Workforces Are the Same A Systematic Revie.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330331","","Humans; Public Health; United States; Workforce; benchmarking; global health workforce; Health Workforce; Occupations; public health workforce; public health workforce definition; public health workforce development; Switzerland; systematic review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We reviewed participatory surveillance systems currently running in 13 different countries. These systems have a growing evidence base showing a high degree of accuracy and increased sensitivity and timeliness relative to traditional healthcare-based systems. They have also proven useful for assessing risk factors, vaccine effectiveness, and patterns of healthcare utilization while being less expensive, more flexible, and more scalable than traditional systems. Nonetheless, they present important challenges including biases associated with the population that chooses to participate, difficulty in adjusting for confounders, and limited specificity because of reliance only on syndromic definitions of disease limits.

While such processes may similarly be employed to enhance the impact of public health initiatives, optimisation has not been defined in the context of public health and there has been little exploration of its key concepts. METHODS: We used a modified, three-round Delphi study with an international group of researchers, public health policy-makers and practitioners to (1) generate a consensus-based definition of optimisation in the context of public health and (2i) describe key considerations for optimisation in that context. A pre-workshop literature review and elicitation of participant views regarding optimisation in public health (round 1) were followed by a daylong workshop and facilitated face-to-face group discussions to refine the definition and generate key considerations (round 2); finally, post-workshop discussions were undertaken to refine and finalise the findings (round 3). A thematic analysis was performed at each round. Study findings reflect an iterative consultation process with study participants. RESULTS: Thirty of 33 invited individuals (91%) participated in the study. Participants reached consensus on the following definition of optimisation in public health: ""A deliberate, iterative and data-driven process to improve a health intervention and/or its implementation to meet stakeholder-defined public health impacts within resource constraints"". A range of optimisation considerations were explored. Optimisation was considered most suitable when existing public health initiatives are not sufficiently effective, meaningful improvements from an optimisation process are anticipated, quality data to assess impacts are routinely available, and there are stable and ongoing resources to support it. Participants believed optimisation could be applied to improve the impacts of an intervention, an implementation strategy or both, on outcomes valued by stakeholders or end users. While optimisation processes were thought to be facilitated by an understanding of the mechanisms of an intervention or implementation strategy, no agreement was reached regarding the best approach to inform decisions about modifications to improve impact. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide a strong basis for future research to explore the potential impact of optimisation in the field of public health.","2019-12-30","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:13","","108","","1","17","","Health Res Policy Syst","Optimisation","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31888666 PMCID: PMC6937822","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\V548NVZY\Wolfenden et al. - 2019 - Optimisation defining and exploring a concept to .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31888666","","Female; Humans; qualitative; Public Health; Health Policy; Internationality; Male; Health Promotion; public health; Qualitative Research; Consensus; Delphi Technique; adaptation; Administrative Personnel; consensus process; Delphi study; Efficiency, Organizational; evidence-based practice; impact; implementation; intervention; Optimisation; Prospective Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there seems to be no mention of payment for services and resources for reimbursement. The term population health can be considered a philosophy of a new model of healthcare based upon future expectations from current laws and studies from the federal government, most notably through the ACA, and healthcare organizations. Radiology departments may perform fewer procedures in the future and receive less money for these complet- ed procedures. Management will need to adjust budgets and staffing to reflect changes.

The federal government continues to put increasing pressure on organizations to shift away from the traditional way of delivering episodic care and move toward managing populations as a whole-before, during, and after a patient presents in a health care facility. Private payers have begun to follow suit as risk-based payer contracts and bundled payment models become increasingly popular. For organizations to adequately influence the health outcomes of a population, they must be responsible for more than just a patient's medical care. They must partner with the community to create a strategy that encompasses the psychosocial and environmental factors that contribute to one's health. Although health care leaders know this industry transformation is imminent, there is minimal research that shares best practices in regard to designing and implementing a successful population health management strategy. Interviews were conducted with leadership from 10 organizations in order to understand the strategic approach taken by delivery systems and health care institutions that view population health as a key aspect of their overall mission. Responses were recorded and outlined in a detailed response grid. The objective is to provide a qualitative overview of how industry leaders are currently responding to population health. Additionally, common themes and recommendations are presented to serve as guidance for other health care organizations that are at the start of their journey toward population health management.","2017-10","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 12:05:37","","368-373","","5","20","","Popul Health Manag","Population Health Research","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28263698","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\569E2G3D\Caldararo et Nash - 2017 - Population Health Research Early Description of t.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28263698","","Humans; Population Health; Delivery of Health Care; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Leadership; organizational change; population health; value-based care; Value-Based Purchasing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: Searches were conducted using PubMed for publications between 2017-01-01 and 2019-12-31. RESULTS: Precision public health is defined as the use of data and evidence to tailor interventions to the characteristics of a single population. It differs from precision medicine in terms of its focus on populations and the limited role of human genomics. High-resolution spatial analysis in a global health context and application of genomics to infectious organisms are areas of progress. Opportunities for informatics research include (i) the development of frameworks for measuring non-clinical concepts, such as social position, (ii) the development of methods for learning from similar populations, and (iii) the evaluation of precision public health implementations. Just as the effects of interventions can differ across populations, predictive models can perform systematically differently across subpopulations due to information bias, sampling bias, random error, and the choice of the output. Algorithm developers, professional societies, and governments can take steps to prevent and mitigate these biases. However, even if the steps to avoid bias are clear in theory, they can be very challenging to accomplish in practice. CONCLUSIONS: Both precision public health and predictive modelling require careful consideration in how subpopulations are defined and access to data on subpopulations can be challenging. While the theory for both topics has advanced considerably, there is much work to be done in understanding how to implement and evaluate these approaches in practice.","2020-08","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 23:15:38","","226-230","","1","29","","Yearb Med Inform","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32823320 PMCID: PMC7442517","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\BF5L2EZH\Buckeridge - 2020 - Precision, Equity, and Public Health and Epidemiol.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32823320","","Humans; Public Health; Epidemiology; Health Equity; Informatics; Precision Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To meet these complex needs, the Association of Schools and Programs in Public Health, the World Health Organization, and the Institute of Medicine promote systems thinking as the only sensible means to respond to issues that greatly exceed the normal capacity of health and medical services. This paper agrees with the application of systems thinking but argues that health organizations have misunderstood and misapplied systems thinking to the extent that the term has become meaningless. This paper presents the basic constructs of systems thinking, explains why systems thinking has been misapplied, examines some misapplications of systems thinking in health, and suggests how the concept can be applied correctly to medicine and public health to achieve the reason it was adopted in the first place.","2013","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 12:05:37","","440-444","","12","72","","","Insights in public health","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objectives were to: (1) explore how systems methodologies are being applied within public health and (2) identify fruitful areas of activity. Design: A systematic review was conducted from existing literature that draws on or uses systems science (in its various forms) and relates to key public health areas of action and concern, including tobacco, alcohol, obesity and the social determinants of health. Data analysis: 117 articles were included in the review. An inductive qualitative content analysis was used for data extraction. The following were systematically extracted from the articles: approach, methodology, transparency, strengths and weaknesses. These were then organised according to theme (ie, commonalities between studies within each category), in order to provide an overview of the state of the field as a whole. The assessment of data quality was intrinsic to the goals of the review itself, and therefore, was carried out as part of the analysis. Results: 4 categories of research were identified from the review, ranging from editorial and commentary pieces to complex system dynamic modelling. Our analysis of each of these categories of research highlighted areas of potential for systems science to strengthen public health efforts, while also revealing a number of limitations in the dynamic systems modelling being carried out in public health. Conclusions: There is a great deal of interest in how the application of systems concepts and approach might aid public health. Our analysis suggests that soft systems modelling techniques are likely to be the most useful addition to public health, and align well with current debate around knowledge transfer and policy. However, the full range of systems methodologies is yet to be engaged with by public health researchers.","2015","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 12:05:37","","","","12","5","","","Systems science and systems thinking for public health","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\VTT3W2XK\Carey et al. - 2015 - Systems science and systems thinking for public he.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The recent restructuring of the National Health Service has drastically changed the organizational structure of Public Health, and has resulted in concerns over the capacity and capabilities of the specialist public health workforce. This paper presents findings from the first phase of a study assessing the capacity and development needs of specialists in public health. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of key public health informants. Four key themes were identified. First, interviewees noted the lack of clarity encompassing the term 'specialist in public health' and the consequent confusion regarding the role of a specialist and the public health function. Second, concern was expressed over the recent fragmentation of the workforce, the loss of critical mass and the potential for professional isolation. This was seen as particularly worrisome in light of a growing public heath agenda. Third, respondents identified key skills gaps within the workforce such as health protection, partnership working and leadership. Last, inadequacies and regional inequities in training and continuing professional development were identified, with interviewees calling for these issues to be addressed immediately. Capacity and skills gaps in the specialist public health workforce are evident and exacerbated by the confusion surrounding the definition of a specialist and, hence, individual roles and responsibilities. The ability of the public health workforce to meet the growing public heath agenda will be dependent on the success of various new mechanisms for joint working, capacity building, and skill enhancement. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.","2004","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 12:05:37","","17-26","","1","14","","","Public health capacity in the new primary care organizations","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\H2PUGX6W\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Public health surveillance dates back to the first recorded epidemic in 3180 B.C. in Egypt. Hippocrates (460 B.C.-370 B.C.) coined the terms endemic and epidemic, John Graunt (1620-1674) introduced systematic data analysis, Samuel Pepys (1633-1703) started epidemic field investigation, William Farr (1807-1883) founded the modern concept of surveillance, John Snow (1813-1858) linked data to intervention, and Alexander Langmuir (1910-1993) gave the first comprehensive definition of surveillance. Current theories, principles, and practice of public health surveillance are summarized. A number of surveillance dichotomies, such as epidemiologic surveillance versus public health surveillance, are described. Some future scenarios are presented, while current activities that can affect the future are summarized: exploring new frontiers; enhancing computer technology; improving epidemic investigations; improving data collection, analysis, dissemination, and use; building on lessons from the past; building capacity; enhancing global surveillance. It is concluded that learning from the past, reflecting on the present, and planning for the future can further enhance public health surveillance.","2012","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 23:10:55","","875253","","","2012","","Scientifica (Cairo)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24278752 PMCID: PMC3820481","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\SEYRT9QY\Choi - 2012 - The past, present, and future of public health sur.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24278752","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Clinical Public Health (CPH) Division was established at the University of Toronto (UofT), Canada to foster inte-gration of primary care, preventive medicine and public health in education, practice and research. To better understand how the construct of CPH might be applied, we surveyed clinicians, researchers and public health professionals affiliated with the CPH Division to assess their understanding of the CPH concept and its utility in fostering broad collaboration.Methods: A two-wave anonymous survey of the active faculty of the CPH Division, UofT was conducted across Canada. Wave 1 participants (n = 187; 2016) were asked to define CPH, while Wave 2 participants (n = 192; 2017) were provided a synthesis of Wave 1 results and asked to rank each definition. Both waves were asked about the need for a common definition, and to comment on CPH.Results: Response rates for the first and second waves were 25% and 22%, respectively. Of the six definitions of CPH from Wave 1, ""the intersection of clinical practice and public health,"" was most highly ranked by Wave 2 participants. Positive perceptions of CPH included multidisciplinary collaboration, new fields and insights, forward thinking and innovation. Negative perceptions included CPH being a confusing term, too narrow in scope or too clinical.Conclusion: The concept of Clinical Public Health can foster multidisciplinary collaboration to address com-plex health issues because it provides a useful framework for bringing together key disciplines and diverse professional specialties.","2021-06","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 23:17:34","","E71-E76","","2","44","","CLIN INVEST MED","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Place: Ottawa, Ontario Publisher: Canadian Society for Clinical Investigation","","; ; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\87WWASKU\display.html; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\W2AIB3J5\Choi et al. - 2021 - Defining Clinical Public Health.pdf","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=151054848&lang=fr&site=ehost-live&scope=cite; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152710","","Humans; Public Health; Canada; Scales; clinical practice; clinical public health; consensus definition; multidisciplinary collaboration; public health practice; Surveys and Questionnaires","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its use in public health is rapidly increasing, although there remains a poor understanding of how these ideas have been imported, adapted and elaborated by public health research networks worldwide. METHOD: This review employed a mixed methods approach to narrate the development of ST in public health. Tabulated results from a literature search of the Web of Science Core Collection database were used to perform a bibliometric analysis and literature review. Annual publication counts and citation scores were used to analyse trends and identify popular and potential 'landmark' publications. Citation network and co-authorship network diagrams were analysed to identify groups of articles and researchers in various network roles. RESULTS: Our search string related to 763 publications. Filtering excluded 208 publications while citation tracing identified 2 texts. The final 557 publications were analysed, revealing a near-exponential growth in literature over recent years. Half of all articles were published after 2010 with almost a fifth (17.8%) published in 2014. Bibliographic analysis identified five distinct citation and co-authorship groups homophilous by common geography, research focus, inspiration or institutional affiliation. As a loosely related set of sciences, many public health researchers have developed different aspects of ST based on their underlying perspective. Early studies were inspired by Management-related literature, while later groups adopted a broadly inclusive understanding which incorporated related Systems sciences and approaches. CONCLUSION: ST is an increasingly popular subject of discussion within public health although its understanding and approaches remain unclear. Briefly tracing the introduction and development of these ideas and author groups in public health literature may provide clarity and opportunities for further learning, research and development.","2017-05-01","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 23:11:32","","585-594","","4","32","","Health Policy Plan","Systems thinking in public health","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28062516","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\F3XKYP3R\Chughtai et Blanchet - 2017 - Systems thinking in public health a bibliographic.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28062516","","Humans; Global Health; Public Health; Public health; Health Services Research; public health; Health systems; Health systems research; Social sciences; Systems thinking; Bibliometrics; health systems research; social sciences; Systems Analysis; systems thinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper first defines and describes ‘containing’ and thinking, with reference to a psychoanalytic model, and compares these definitions with similar concepts. The circumstances that promote or impede the development of the capacity for thought are then outlined, and a spectrum of this capacity is described and correlated with a spectrum of vulnerability-resilience to ill health. A review of the associated literature indicates significant links to health-related behaviours, health outcomes and inequalities; interventions at a population level could aim to shift people at the vulnerable end of the spectrum towards resilience. However such measures are unlikely to be effective on their own: what is needed is a containing and thinking society, characterised by a wish to know about reality, and to link together information about the state of its citizens and the wider world. The paper concludes with a discussion of the political and policy-making implications. © 2007, Emerald Group Publishing Limited","2007","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","40-48","","3","6","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","","Public health; Containment; Health inequalities; Psychoanalysis; Thinking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Drawing on the successful experiences of Switzerland, Georgia, and New Zealand in dealing with COVID-19, we suggest prioritizing core public health capacities with links to the International Health Regulations, improving international cooperation, coordination, and multisectoral action, addressing health inequities by targeting vulnerable groups, and enhancing health literacy, including through sophisticated and sustained communication campaigns to build resilience.

In 2002 and following years, the scenario changed dramatically with the advent of the new more pathogenic CoVs, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndome (SARS-CoV-1), Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, and the new zoonotic SARS-CoV-2, likely originated from bat species and responsible for the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19), which to date has caused 15,581,007 confirmed cases and 635,173 deaths in 208 countries, including Italy. SARS-CoV-2 transmission is mainly airborne via droplets generated by symptomatic patients, and possibly asymptomatic individuals during incubation of the disease, although for the latter, there are no certain data yet. However, research on asymptomatic viral infection is currently ongoing worldwide to elucidate the real prevalence and mortality of the disease. From a clinical point of view, COVID-19 would be defined as ""COVID Planet "" because it presents as a multifaceted disease, due to the large number of organs and tissues infected by the virus. Overall, based on the available published data, 80.9% of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 develop a mild disease/infection, 13.8% severe pneumonia, 4.7% respiratory failure, septic shock, or multi-organ failure, and 3% of these cases are fatal, but mortality parameter is highly variable in different countries. Clinically, SARS-CoV-2 causes severe primary interstitial viral pneumonia and a ""cytokine storm syndrome"", characterized by a severe and fatal uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response triggered by the activation of interleukin 6 (IL-6) with development of endothelitis and generalized thrombosis that can lead to organ failure and death. Risk factors include advanced age and comorbidities including hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Virus entry occurs via binding the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor present in almost all tissues and organs through the Spike (S) protein. Currently, SARS-CoV-2 infection is prevented by the use of masks, social distancing, and improved hand hygiene measures. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the main biological and clinical features of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, also focusing on the principal measures taken in some Italian regions to face the emergency and on the most important treatments used to manage the COVID-19 pandemic.","2020-08-12","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","1228","","8","8","","Microorganisms","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32806657 PMCID: PMC7464234","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\IAELIJGA\Contini et al. - 2020 - COVID-19 Is a Multifaceted Challenging Pandemic Wh.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32806657","","COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; COVID-19 planet; cytokine storm syndrome; endothelitis; hyperinflammation; thromboembolism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, we discuss the centrality of welfare chauvinism to the PRR's impact on health, taking this as a cue for a broader reflection on the importance on distinguishing between the nativist and populist dimensions of PRR politics. Secondly, we turn our attention to the potential moderating effect of the PRR's welfare chauvinism on the welfare cuts proposed by their right-wing coalition partners, comments we see as pointing to the need to focus on nativist, populist, neoliberal and other threats to welfare policy more generally, rather than on the PRR only. Thirdly, we reflect on the paradoxical nature of welfare chauvinism - its negative consequences for the health of the 'own people' it proclaims to defend - as a starting point for a brief discussion of the need to consider carefully the not-so-straightforward relation between the PRR's political rhetoric, its (impact on) policy and institutions, and the outcomes of such policy.","2021-08-01","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","523-527","","8","10","","Int J Health Policy Manag","Getting the Problem Definition Right","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32772009 PMCID: PMC9056193","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\C62N5VW7\De Cleen et Speed - 2021 - Getting the Problem Definition Right The Radical .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32772009","","Humans; Europe; Public Health; Health Policy; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Population Health; Politics; Nativism; Populism; Radical Right","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The literature on SWB is vast and dispersed across multiple disciplines. However, few reviews have summarized the theoretical and empirical tenets of SWB literature across disciplinary boundaries. METHODS: We cataloged and consolidated SWB-related theories and empirical evidence from the fields of psychology and public health using a combination of online catalogs of scholarly articles and online search engines to retrieve relevant articles. For both theories and determinants/correlates of SWB, PubMed, PsychINFO, and Google Scholar were used to obtain relevant articles. Articles for the review were screened for relevance, varied perspectives, journal impact, geographic location of study, and topicality. A core theme of SWB empirical literature was the identification of SWB determinants/correlates, and over 100 research articles were reviewed and summarized for this review. RESULTS: We found that SWB theories can be classified into four groups: fulfillment and engagement theories, personal orientation theories, evaluative theories, and emotional theories. A critical analysis of the conflicts and overlaps between these theories reveals the lack of a coherent theoretical and methodological framework that would make empirical research systematically comparable. We found that determinants/correlates of SWB can be grouped into seven broad categories: basic demographics, socioeconomic status, health and functioning, personality, social support, religion and culture, and geography and infrastructure. However, these are rarely studied consistently or used to test theories. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of a clear, unifying theoretical basis for categorizing and comparing empirical studies can potentially be overcome using an operationalizable criterion that focuses on the dimension of SWB studied, measure of SWB used, design of the study, study population, and types of determinants and correlates. From our review of the empirical literature on SWB, we found that the seven categories of determinants/correlates identified may potentially be used to improve the link between theory and empirical research, and that the overlap in the determinant/correlates as they relate to multiple theory categories may enable us to test theories in unison. However, doing so in the future would require a conscious effort by researchers in several areas, which are discussed.","2020-11-19","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","25","","1","41","","Public Health Rev","Understanding subjective well-being","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33292677 PMCID: PMC7678314","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\Z5YDU8RT\Das et al. - 2020 - Understanding subjective well-being perspectives .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33292677","","Public health; Affective; Cognitive; Determinants and correlates; Happiness; Interdisciplinary review; Life evaluation; Psychology; Subjective well-being; Theories","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

E.","Public health implications of environmental exposures","Environmental Health Perspectives","","0091-6765","10.1289/ehp.98106s1369","","The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) is a public health agency with responsibility for assessing the public health implications associated with uncontrolled releases of hazardous substances into the environment. The biological effects of low-level exposures are a primary concern in these assessments. One of the tools used by the agency for this purpose is the risk assessment paradigm originally outlined and described by the National Academy of Science in 1983. Because of its design and inherent concepts, risk assessment has been variously employed by a number of environmental and public health agencies and programs as a means to organize information, as a decision support tool, and as a working hypothesis for biologically based inference and extrapolation. Risk assessment has also been the subject of significant critical review. The ATSDR recognizes the utility of both the qualitative and quantitative conclusions provided by traditional risk assessment, but the agency uses such estimates only in the broader context of professional judgment, internal and external peer review, and extensive public review and comment. This multifaceted approach is consistent with the Council on Environmental Quality's description and use of risk analysis as an organizing construct based on sound biomedical and other scientific judgment in concert with risk assessment to define plausible exposure ranges of concern rather than a single numerical estimate that may convey an artificial sense of precision. In this approach biomedical opinion, host factors, mechanistic interpretation, molecular epidemiology, and actual exposure conditions are all critically important in evaluating the significance of environmental exposure to hazardous substances. As such, the ATSDR risk analysis approach is a multidimensional endeavor encompassing not only the components of risk assessment but also the principles of biomedical judgment, risk management, and risk communication. Within this framework of risk analysis, the ATSDR may rely on one or more of a number of interrelated principles and approaches to screen, organize information, set priorities, make decisions, and define future research needs and directions.","1998-02","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","369-378","","Suppl 1","106 Suppl 1","","Environ Health Perspect","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9539032 PMCID: PMC1533270","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\K3CPE8YZ\De Rosa et al. - 1998 - Public health implications of environmental exposu.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9539032","","Humans; Public Health; Adaptation, Physiological; Environmental Exposure; Risk Assessment; Biological Availability; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Toxicology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the concepts have practical value as they can be used in designing new systems as well as understanding or evaluating currently operating systems.

We systematically searched the peer-reviewed literature to identify public health and health policy research involving deliberative methods and report how deliberative methods have been used. We applied a taxonomy developed with reference to health policy and science and technology studies literatures to distinguish how deliberative methods engage different publics: citizens (ordinary people who are unfamiliar with the issues), consumers (those with relevant personal experience e.g. of illness) and advocates (those with technical expertise or partisan interests). We searched four databases for empirical studies in English published 1996-2013. This identified 78 articles reporting on 62 distinct events from the UK, USA, Canada, Australasia, Europe, Israel, Asia and Africa. Ten different types of deliberative techniques were used to represent and capture the interests and preferences of different types of public. Citizens were typically directed to consider community interests and were treated as a resource to increase democratic legitimacy. Citizens were preferred in methodological studies (those focused on understanding the techniques). Consumers were directed to focus on personal preferences; thus convened not as a source of policy decisions, but of knowledge about what those affected by the issue would accept. Advocates-who are most commonly used as expert witnesses in juries-were sometimes engaged to deliberate with consumers or citizens. This almost always occurred in projects directly linked to policy processes. This suggests health policymakers may value deliberative methods as a way of understanding disagreement between perspectives. Overall however, the 'type' of public sought was often not explicit, and their role not specified. This review provides new insight into the heterogeneity and rising popularity of deliberative methods, and indicates a need for greater clarity regarding both the constitution of publics and the relative usefulness of different deliberative techniques.","2015-04","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","114-121","","","131","","Soc Sci Med","Which public and why deliberate?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25770463","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\33UI3WDK\Degeling et al. - 2015 - Which public and why deliberate--A scoping review.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770463","","Humans; Public Health; Public health; Health Policy; United States; Canada; Community Participation; Policy Making; Deliberative methods; Health policy; Policy making; Public Opinion; Public participation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article summarizes how the conceptualization of AD has evolved in response to research advances. Current challenges, including the impact of multimorbidity are outlined and potential targets for prevention are discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: The ability to study AD neuropathology in vivo and results from longitudinal epidemiologic studies have led to a consensus that AD has a long preclinical course spanning decades. This view is driving efforts to identify early markers that will identify individuals at risk for AD dementia. SUMMARY: Critical questions remain regarding the pathological mechanisms underlying AD and their relation to clinical symptoms. Nevertheless, evidence suggests that interventions targeting modifiable risk factors may slow or prevent the onset of disease while the search for a cure continues.","2020-06","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","68-76","","2","7","","Curr Epidemiol Rep","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35813934 PMCID: PMC9266412","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\73WB2Y3F\Derby - 2020 - Trends in the public health significance, definiti.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35813934","","Alzheimer’s Disease; Mild Cognitive Impairment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quality improvement (QI) interventions seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public health programs, services, or organizations. The purpose of this study was to review the literature to describe public health system QI interventions and their impact on public health practices and health outcomes. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review was conducted using PRISMA guidelines. Three databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles that included public health quality improvement-related terms in their abstracts. Articles published in 1990-2010 that described results from QI interventions conducted within the U.S. public health system were included. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Fifteen studies were identified, reporting on 18 separate QI interventions. Studies fell naturally into three functional categories: organization-wide QI, program- or service-specific QI, and administrative or management function QI. Few of the studies linked their improvements directly to a health outcome or predictors of health outcomes. Studies generally were implemented in state-level or large local public health departments. CONCLUSIONS: Formally published QI interventions may not be representative of typical, smaller-scale QI activities. Collection and distribution of QI results associated with proven, effective public health interventions and that quantify the benefits of QI practices in public health should be a goal. More research is needed to definitively ""connect the dots"" between QI efforts, resulting practice improvements, and actual (or predictors of) health outcome improvements. Future studies should examine QI in diverse public health systems.","2012-05","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","S58-71","","5 Suppl 1","42","","Am J Prev Med","Quality improvement interventions in public health systems","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 22502926","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22502926","","Humans; Public Health; United States; Public Health Administration; Quality Improvement; Databases, Bibliographic; Healthy People Programs; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Avance Center for the Advancement of Immigrant/Refugee Health, a health disparities research center in the Washington, DC area, includes as part of its mission a multi-level, participatory community intervention (called Adelante) to address the co-occurrence of substance abuse, violence and sex risk among Latino immigrant youth and young adults. Research staff and community partners knew that the intervention community had grown beyond its Census-designated place (CDP) boundaries, and that connection and attachment to community were relevant to an intervention. Thus, in order to understand current geographic and social boundaries of the community for sampling, data collection, intervention design and implementation, the research team conducted an ethnographic study to identify self-defined community boundaries, both geographic and social. Beginning with preliminary data from a pilot intervention and the original CDP map, the research included: geo-mapping de-identified addresses of service clients from a major community organization; key informant interviews; and observation and intercept interviews in the community. The results provided an expanded community boundary profile and important information about community identity.","2015","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","27-41","","1","74","","Hum Organ","DEFINING THE ""COMMUNITY"" FOR A COMMUNITY-BASED PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTION ADDRESSING LATINO IMMIGRANT HEALTH DISPARITIES","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 25892743 PMCID: PMC4398025","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\BIB63SM4\Edberg et al. - 2015 - DEFINING THE COMMUNITY FOR A COMMUNITY-BASED PUB.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25892743","","community intervention; Ethnographic community mapping; Latino health disparities; Latino youth","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Referred to as girl child marriage, the formal or informal union of the girl-child before age 18, the practice is increasingly recognized as a key roadblock to global health, development, and gender equality. Although more research than ever has focused on girl child marriage, an important gap remains in deconstructing the construct. Through an extensive review of primary and secondary sources, including legal documents, peer-reviewed articles, books, and grey literature across disciplines, we explore what the term ""girl child marriage"" means and why it more accurately captures current global efforts than other terms like early, teenage, or adolescent marriage. To do this, we dive into different framings on marriage, children, and gender. We find that there has been historical change in the understanding of girl child marriage in published literature since the late 1800s, and that it is a political, sociocultural, and value-laden term that serves a purpose in different contexts at different moments in time. The lack of harmonized terminology, particularly in the global public health, prevents alignment amongst different stakeholders in understanding what the problem is in order to determine how to measure it and create solutions on how to address it. Our intent is to encourage more intentional use of language in global public health research.","2020-10-15","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","1547","","1","20","","BMC Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33054856 PMCID: PMC7560271","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\VRMP4W9E\Efevbera et Bhabha - 2020 - Defining and deconstructing girl child marriage an.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33054856","","Female; Humans; Global Health; Adolescent; Child; Age Factors; Child marriage; Definition; Girl; Health; Marriage","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, between the two phases is operational readiness that comprises the immediate actions needed to respond to a developing risk or hazard. Currently, emergency readiness is embedded in multiple frameworks and policy documents related to the health emergency cycle. However, knowledge about operational readiness' critical readiness components and actions required by countries to respond to public health eminent threat is not well known. Therefore, we aim to define and identify the critical elements of 'operational readiness' for public health emergencies, including COVID-19, and identify lessons learnt from addressing it, to inform the WHO Operational Readiness Framework. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidance. Reporting will be according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science databases and grey literature will be searched and exported into an online systematic review software (eg, Rayyan in this case) for review. The review team, which apart from scoping review methodological experts include content experts in health systems and public health and emergency medicine, prepared an a priori study protocol in consultation with WHO representatives. ATLAS.ti V.9 will be used to conduct thematic data analysis as well as store, organise and retrieve data. Data analysis and presentation will be carried out by five reviewers. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This review will reveal new insights, knowledge and lessons learnt that will translate into an operational framework for readiness actions. In consultation with WHO, findings will be disseminated as appropriate (eg, through professional bodies, conferences and research papers). No ethics approvals are required as no humans will be involved in data collection. PROTOCOL REGISTRATION: This rapid scoping review has been registered on Open Science Framework (doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/6SYAH).","2022-09-19","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 23:14:31","","e060526","","9","12","","BMJ Open","Defining and identifying critical elements of, and lessons learned from addressing, 'operational readiness' for public health emergency events, including COVID-19","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36123065 PMCID: PMC9485644","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\3A96ZPWJ\English et al. - 2022 - Defining and identifying critical elements of, and.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36123065","","Humans; Public Health; COVID-19; Review Literature as Topic; ACCIDENT & EMERGENCY MEDICINE; INFECTIOUS DISEASES; PUBLIC HEALTH; Systematic Reviews as Topic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some of the contributions most notable for their impact on mortality and longevity are vaccine development and widespread use, smallpox eradication, large reductions in communicable disease epidemics, and the rise and decline of several serious chronic diseases. Many methodological advances have facilitated better understanding of disease processes and opportunities for control. Epidemiological methods have advanced, but studies often ignore the determinants of health at the community level and above, leading to simplistic formulations of multiple risk factors contributing to chronic and other diseases and injuries. Occupational and environmental health developed as disciplines in this century, making significant contributions to current and future population health. The health care system became more organized, technologically sophisticated, and costly. New tools to assess health and the burden of ill health, to improve the effectiveness of interventions, and to measure economic effects of alternative investments promise greater efficiency and effectiveness for public health. An increasingly fragmented public health infrastructure must confront unprecedented challenges including dramatic global population growth, increased aging of the population associated with enhanced longevity, and possible irreversible changes in key environmental health determinants.","1999","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","xiii-xxx","","","20","","Annu Rev Public Health","Public health in the twentieth century","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10352845","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10352845","","Humans; Public Health; United States; Health Care Reform; Public Health Administration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, some challenges to implementing regional health planning are identified, such as difficulties in coordinating actions and services in different geographic locations, with different managements to meet population health needs with adequate scale, quality, and cost. In this context, intercity health consortia emerge as an organizational solution that allows better coordination and integration between federative entities, and their main benefits are scale gain in public services delivery; rationalization of processes and expenses; and realization of joint projects that would be impossible to be implemented if managed and funded in isolation. This paper aims to understand how health consortia reach better performance in the procurement and hiring of services by cooperative action through a narrative literature review. The results are organized into three parts: i) definition and concepts of public consortium; ii) definition and concepts of intercity health consortium (CIS); iii) health consortium case studies in Brazil.","2020-01","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","325-338","","1","25","","Cien Saude Colet","Public Health consortia","","","","","","","por, eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31859880","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\CXTER33X\Flexa et Barbastefano - 2020 - Public Health consortia a literature review.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31859880","","Humans; Public Health Administration; Brazil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Whereas health literacy has traditionally been operationalized as an individual-level construct, public health literacy takes into account the complex social, ecologic, and systemic forces affecting health and well-being. However, public health literacy has not yet been fully articulated. This paper addresses this gap by outlining a broad, new definition of public health literacy. This definition was developed through an inductive analytic process conducted in 2007 by a multidisciplinary research team, and two expert-panel sessions were convened to assess the consensual validity of the emergent definition. Based on this process, public health literacy is defined as the degree to which individuals and groups can obtain, process, understand, evaluate, and act on information needed to make public health decisions that benefit the community. Three dimensions of public health literacy--conceptual foundations, critical skills, and civic orientation--and related competencies are also proposed. Public health literacy is distinct from individual-level health literacy, and together, the two types of literacy form a more comprehensive model of health literacy. A five-part agenda is offered for future research and action aimed at increasing levels of public health literacy.","2009-05","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 23:15:31","","446-451","","5","36","","AM J PREV MED","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","Place: New York, New York Publisher: Elsevier B.V.","","; ","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=105502550&lang=fr&site=ehost-live&scope=cite; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19362698","","Humans; Public Health; Health Education; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Terminology as Topic; Health Literacy; Attitude to Health; Educational Status; Nomenclature","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If public health's effectiveness and profile are to grow, practitioners and researchers will need reliable, timely information with which to make information-driven decisions, better ways to communicate, and improved tools to analyze and present new knowledge. ""Public Health Informatics"" (PHI) is the science of applying Information-Age technology to serve the specialized needs of public health. In this paper we define Public Health Informatics, outline specific benefits that may accrue from its widespread application, and discuss why and how an academic discipline of public health informatics should be developed. Finally, we make specific recommendations for actions that government and academia can take to assure that public health professionals have the systems, tools, and training to use PHI to advance the mission of public health.","1995","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","239-252","","","16","","Annu Rev Public Health","Public health informatics","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 7639873","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\TBUAC5VX\Friede et al. - 1995 - Public health informatics how information-age tec.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7639873","","United States; Health Education; Public Health Administration; Communication; Software; Computer Communication Networks; Information Services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The declaration of a national emergency in the United States (13 March 2020) necessitated the addition and modification of terminology related to COVID-19 and development of the disease's case definition. During this period, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and standard development organizations released guidance on data standards for reporting COVID-19 clinical encounters, laboratory results, cause-of-death certifications, and other surveillance processes for COVID-19 PH emergency operations. The CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository was created to address the need for PH and health-care stakeholders at local and national levels to easily obtain access to comprehensive and up-to-date information management resources. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We introduce the clinical and health-care informatics community to the CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository: a new, national COVID-19 information management tool. We provide a description of COVID-19 informatics resources, including data requirements for COVID-19 data reporting. RESULTS: We demonstrate the CDC COVID-19 Information Management Repository's categorization and management of critical COVID-19 informatics documentation and standards. We also describe COVID-19 data exchange standards, forms, and specifications.

We review and comment on the long-used guidelines for interpreting evidence as supporting a causal association and contrast them with the potential outcomes framework that encourages thinking in terms of causes that are interventions. We argue that in public health this framework is more suitable, providing an estimate of an action's consequences rather than the less precise notion of a risk factor's causal effect. A variety of modern statistical methods adopt this approach. When an intervention cannot be specified, causal relations can still exist, but how to intervene to change the outcome will be unclear. In application, the often-complex structure of causal processes needs to be acknowledged and appropriate data collected to study them. These newer approaches need to be brought to bear on the increasingly complex public health challenges of our globalized world.","2013","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","61-75","","","34","","Annu Rev Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23297653 PMCID: PMC4079266","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\XACB8UHK\Glass et al. - 2013 - Causal inference in public health.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23297653","","Humans; Public Health; Health Promotion; Causality; Outcome Assessment, Health Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the field is at an inflection point. COVID-19 is an infectious disease, and commercial actions that increase COVID-19-related morbidity would typically fall outside CDoH definitions. We therefore felt it was timely to review and analyse the heterogeneity present in this field, and recommend a unified definition of CDoH. Methods: We conducted a rapid literature review. We catalogued and analysed the current terms and industries in the academic literature related to CDoH. We mapped the field using a Sankey diagram, which shows the connections between predefined nodes. In this case, the nodes are: the terms (e.g. CDoH) and associated sectors (e.g. tobacco, alcohol, or unhealthy foods). We then analysed the definitions using a conceptual framework we developed. Results: We screened and included 122 full text articles. Our Sankey diagram demonstrated that ‘commercial determinants of health’ is superseding ‘corporate determinants of health’ and all other terms as the most common terminology in this field over time. Furthermore, our conceptual framework and analysis demonstrated that the choice of definition has significance for which industries and activities fall within the scope of CDoH research. Conclusions: Narrow definitions of CDoH pose a challenge to equity. As the field of CDoH develops, definitions - and the research that flows from them - need to more consistently consider a wider range of both NCDs and IDs, not least to avoid the existing structural inequities in research. A narrow focus on NCDs may skew policy solutions toward those which are most relevant to NCDs and higher income populations. Key messages: • Researchers in commercial determinants of health(CDoH) have previously called for clarity on the appropriate definition of CDoH in this nascent field, which we provide in our research. • We used mixed analytical methods (including literature review, Sankey diagrams, and conceptual frameworks) to develop the field of CDoH research for a post-COVID-19 world.","2021-10-02","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-13 16:58:18","iii306-iii307","","","31","","EUR J PUBLIC HEALTH","","","","","","","","","","","","","EBSCOhost","","Publisher: Oxford University Press / USA","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\BTEI6ECH\Glover et Petticrew - 2021 - Defining the commercial determinants of health aft.pdf","","","COVID-19; Social Determinants of Health; Congresses and Conferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here we aim to assess the extent that epidemiological methods, as covered in contemporary standard textbooks, provide tools that can assess the relative magnitude of public health problems and can be used to help rank and assess public health priorities. STUDY DESIGN: Narrative literature review. METHODS: Thirty textbooks were grouped into three categories; pure, extended or applied epidemiology, were reviewed with attention to the ways the discipline is characterised and the nature of the analytical methods described. RESULTS: Pure texts tend to present a strict hierarchy of methods with those metrics deemed to best serve aetiological inquiry at the top. Extended and applied texts employ broader definitions of epidemiology but in most cases, the metrics described are also those used in aetiological inquiry and may not be optimal for capturing the consequences and social importance of injuries and disease onsets. CONCLUSIONS: The primary scientific purpose of epidemiology, even amongst 'applied' textbooks, is aetiological inquiry.

OBJECTIVES.—: To answer the following questions: (1) what is the impact of population health and population health management on pathologists; (2) what roles are pathologists playing in population health management; (3) is population health something that pathologists in both larger and smaller settings can engage in; (4) are pathologists in a position to analyze laboratory data for population health, and, if so, what are the key information sources those pathologists must access; and (5) what steps can a pathologist take to become involved in population health? DESIGN.—: We conducted 10 semistructured interviews with pathologists and other medical laboratory leaders who have been active in population health. These interviews were supplemented with a review of the medical literature. RESULTS.—: Pathologists have demonstrated that laboratory data can provide unique value-added contributions to improving the health of populations. These contributions are not limited to pathologists in large, integrated settings. However, pathologists need to be proactive to contribute to health systems' population health efforts and may need to both enhance their own skills and the quality of their data to maximize the value of their contributions.

METHODS: We addressed the possible problems that might arise based on this proposal accounting for clinical, pathophysiological, impact and public health aspects. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Defining chronic migraine on the basis of headache frequency alone does not account for clinical and pathophysiological aspects, as well as for the impact of chronic migraine in terms of disability and quality of life. Moreover, it is potentially harmful for patients in terms of allocation of resources. These issues are discussed in the present manuscript, and we support the idea of defining high frequency episodic migraine as an independent entity as a viable path to follow.","2020-04","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","407-410","","4","40","","Cephalalgia","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31840532","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31840532","","Humans; Public Health; Risk Factors; Chronic Disease; Chronic migraine; chronification; disability; Disability Evaluation; high-frequency episodic migraine; ICHD-3; Migraine Disorders; Quality of Life","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the first time since its 1979 establishment, the Healthy People framework aims to attain health literacy as an overarching goal and foundational principle to achieving health and well-being. Growing literature on health literacy describes it as a concept not solely reliant on individual capabilities but also on organizations' ability to make health-related information and services equitably accessible and comprehensible. PROGRAM: The US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) updates the Healthy People objectives each decade based on the most current science. For the development of Healthy People 2030, HHS drew on recommendations from the Secretary's Advisory Committee on National Health Promotion and Disease Prevention Objectives for 2030 (Secretary's Advisory Committee), an independent advisory committee of national health experts, to update the 20-year old individual-focused Healthy People definition of health literacy. HHS solicited input from members of the public and users on the proposed changes to that definition. IMPLEMENTATION: HHS published a Federal Register notice to solicit public comments, which were qualitatively analyzed by government staff. EVALUATION: The 2 separate analyses revealed plurality support for improving the definition to focus on both individual and organizational roles in health literacy. Results led HHS subject matter experts to update the definition to include definitions of personal health literacy and organizational health literacy. Healthy People 2030's expanded health literacy definition reflects the most current science and input from the Secretary's Advisory Committee, public comments, and HHS subject matter experts. DISCUSSION: The updated definition is intended to advance Healthy People 2030's health literacy goals particularly as more organizations in public health and other sectors acknowledge their role in the delivery of quality health information and services.","2021-12-01","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:06:42","","S258-S264","","Suppl 6","27","","J Public Health Manag Pract","Updating Health Literacy for Healthy People 2030","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33729194 PMCID: PMC8435055","","; ; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\WMQZVAZR\Santana et al. - 2021 - Updating Health Literacy for Healthy People 2030 .pdf","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=152621940&lang=fr&site=ehost-live&scope=cite; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33729194","","Humans; Public Health; Health Policy; United States; Adult; Health Promotion; Health Education; Organizational Objectives; Health Status; Health Literacy; population health; Nomenclature; disease prevention; health communication; health competencies; Health Information; health literacy; health promotion; Health Promotion -- Methods; Health Services Accessibility; Healthy People; organizational health literacy; Psychological Well-Being; Public Health -- United States; Advisory Committees; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although widely used, it is unclear how the concepts of multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinarity are applied with respect to the public health workforce. We conducted a scoping review and qualitative content analysis to provide an overview of how the concepts of multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinarity are defined and applied in the academic literature about the public health workforce. Of the 1957 records identified, 324 articles were included in the review. Of those, 193, 176, and 53 mentioned the concepts of multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinarity, respectively. Overall, 44 articles provided a definition. Whilst definitions of multidisciplinarity were scarce, definitions of inter- and transdisciplinarity were more common and richer, highlighting the aim of the collaboration and the blurring and dissolution of disciplinary boundaries. A better understanding of the application of multi-, inter-, and transdisciplinarity is an important step to implementing these concepts in practice, including in institutional structures, academic curricula, and approaches in tackling public health challenges.","2022-09-01","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:06:32","","10902","","17","19","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","Multi-, Inter-, and Transdisciplinarity within the Public Health Workforce","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36078616 PMCID: PMC9517885","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\4V4PJSDI\Sell et al. - 2022 - Multi-, Inter-, and Transdisciplinarity within the.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36078616","","Public Health; Curriculum; public health; Workforce; global health; Health Workforce; public health workforce; collaboration; interdisciplinarity; multidisciplinarity; multiprofessional; one health; transdisciplinarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the early context of restrictions caused by COVID-19, this commentary highlights our research setbacks and challenges, and the ways in which we are adapting research methodologies, while considering ethical implications related to the pandemic and their impacts on conducting global and public health research. As we learn to become increasingly aware of some of our limitations in the face of the pandemic, some positives are also worth highlighting: we are mobilizing our training and research skills to participate in COVID-19 projects and to disseminate knowledge on COVID-19, including through papers such as this one.

This may be partly due to the way screening is described and explained in textbooks and journal articles. AIM: To review prominent public health and epidemiology textbooks, dictionaries, and relevant journal publications for definitions and examples of screening, with the aim of identifying common usages and concepts, as well as sources of potential confusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Commonly available epidemiology and public health textbooks and peer reviewed journals were searched for definitions and examples of screening. The search located seven journal articles, 10 textbooks, and one dictionary. The search platforms used were Pubmed, BIOSIS, EMBASE, Medline-OVID and Scopus under the Epidemiology and Biostatics subject head listed with Life Sciences. RESULTS: Descriptions of screening give varying emphasis to whether it is a test or a program, the aims of screening, the setting in which it is conducted, eligibility criteria, who initiates and who is intended to benefit and whether the condition being screened is an infectious or chronic disease or a risk-elevated state. Four essentially different 'types' of screening are described, using seven terms and occasionally contradictory examples. The detection of asymptomatic infectious cases is gradually changing from screening to surveillance as part of infection control. CONCLUSION: Voluntary screening programs rely on high participation to be effective and support and trust of the public are essential for the continued success of the public health profession. Consistent terminology is important for patients, providers and policymakers to understand what screening is and is not. Clear definitions are needed if we are to evaluate and communicate the risks and benefits of screening in public health.","2017-03","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:06:18","","LE01-LE04","","3","11","","J Clin Diagn Res","Screening in Public Health and Clinical Care","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28511418 PMCID: PMC5427344","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\KNPAD3I9\Speechley et al. - 2017 - Screening in Public Health and Clinical Care Simi.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28511418","","Clinical practice; Public health screening programs; Surveillance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The concept of PHM has been used in various settings and has been defined in different ways. This study compared the definitions of PHM used in the literature in order to improve the understanding and interpretation of the concept of PHM. A scoping literature search was performed for papers published between January 2000 and January 2015 that defined PHM. PHM definitions were summarized, focusing on: (1) overall aim, (2) PHM activities, and (3) contextual factors. Eighteen articles were retrieved. The overall aim was defined in terms of health (N = 14), costs (N = 8), and/or quality of care (N = 10). Definitions varied regarding the description of PHM activities, though all definitions contained elements in common with disease management and health promotion. Data management, Triple Aim assessment, risk stratification, evaluation, and feedback cycles were less likely to be mentioned. Contextual factors were scarcely brought forward in the definitions. Moderate variations were found across definitions in the way PHM was conceptualized. Frequently, essential elements of PHM were not specified. Differences in conceptualizations of PHM should be taken into account when comparing PHM initiatives that are working toward improvements in population health, (experienced) quality of care, and reduction of costs.","2017-02","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:06:11","","74-85","","1","20","","Popul Health Manag","Defining Population Health Management","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27124406","","; ","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=120926885&lang=fr&site=ehost-live&scope=cite; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27124406","","Humans; Population Health; Health Promotion; Terminology as Topic; Risk Assessment; Population; Data Collection; Health; Cost Control; Literature Review; Quality of Health Care -- Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Leaders in these states have chosen to use emergency powers that are normally reserved for sudden catastrophes to address these enduring public health issues.

SUMMARY: A key concept in defining population health activities is clearly delineating the population(s) of focus. The Institute for Healthcare Improvement's (IHI's) Triple Aim Initiative uses the term population health management to describe the work by healthcare organizations to improve outcomes for individual patients to maximize population health. The National Academy of Medicine favors the term population health improvement and uses this term to describe work to identify and improve aspects of or contributors to population health, expanding the focus beyond traditional healthcare delivery systems. As organizations like IHI and the National Academy of Medicine continue to focus on population health, the terms and definitions used to describe these activities will continue to evolve.

Between 17 March and 7 July 2003, as a result of dilemmas in balancing sensitivity and specificity, five different case definitions were used. The patients referred for SARS assessment were analysed from a public health perspective. None of the patients referred had SARS, based on serological and virological criteria. Nevertheless, all 72 patients required thorough assessment and, depending on the results of the assessment, institution of appropriate prevention and control measures. Changing case definitions caused confusion in classifying cases. A centralised assessment of the reported cases by a team with clinical and public health expertise (epidemiological and geographical risk assessment) is a practical solution for addressing differences in applying case definitions. The burden of managing non-cases is an important issue when allocating public health resources, and should be taken into account during the preparation phase, rather than during an outbreak. This applies not only to SARS, but also to other public health threats, such as pandemic influenza or a bioterrorist episode.","2006-12","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:57","","1214-1220","","12","12","","Clin Microbiol Infect","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17121628 PMCID: PMC7129494","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\8WMCQC7J\Timen et al. - 2006 - Public health implications of using various case d.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17121628","","Female; Humans; Public Health; Population Surveillance; Male; Communicable Disease Control; World Health Organization; Disease Outbreaks; Antibodies, Viral; Assessment; Case definition; Infection Control; Management; Netherlands; Public health threats; Reference Standards; Resource Allocation; Retrospective Studies; Risk assessment; SARS; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome; Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A robust public health response to the high levels of communicable and non-communicable diseases is required.

This paper examines these questions by means of a review of literature published in Russia and interviews with key informants. It concludes that although many of the determinants of health in Russia have been identified, they are typically discussed in a general way. Research on the major determinants of disease in Russia, and published in the international literature, appears to have had little impact. The need for reform to enhance the public health response is recognized. Goals of reform have been described but are poorly defined and there is typically little relationship between a stated goal and the strategy proposed to achieve it. There is a lack of clarity about what is meant by public health, and key concepts, such as inter-sectoral and multi-disciplinary working, are either ignored or misunderstood. Evidence of capacity for managed change is weak. There is an urgent need to create a shared awareness of evidence on the nature of the health challenges facing Russia and the evidence base for both the content of potential responses and the strategies that might be adopted to implement them.","2000-06","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:53","","164-169","","2","15","","Health Policy Plan","Public health in Russia","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10837039","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\Y6GX5LKZ\Tkatchenko et al. - 2000 - Public health in Russia the view from the inside.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837039","","Humans; Europe; Developed Countries; Public Health; Health Policy; Health Care Reform; Public Health Administration; Interviews as Topic; Health; Attitude to Health; Literature Review; Behavior; Eastern Europe; New Independent States; Organization And Administration; Planning; Policy Development; Psychological Factors; Russia; Social Values; Value Orientation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First Steps Toward a Definition and an Intervention Classification Framework","Journal of Medical Internet Research","","1438-8871","10.2196/31921","","Digital public health is an emerging field in population-based research and practice. The fast development of digital technologies provides a fundamentally new understanding of improving public health by using digitalization, especially in prevention and health promotion. The first step toward a better understanding of digital public health is to conceptualize the subject of the assessment by defining what digital public health interventions are. This is important, as one cannot evaluate tools if one does not know what precisely an intervention in this field can be. Therefore, this study aims to provide the first definition of digital public health interventions. We will merge leading models for public health functions by the World Health Organization, a framework for digital health technologies by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, and a user-centered approach to intervention development. Together, they provide an overview of the functions and areas of use for digital public health interventions. Nevertheless, one must keep in mind that public health functions can differ among different health care systems, limiting our new framework's universal validity. We conclude that a digital public health intervention should address essential public health functions through digital means. Furthermore, it should include members of the target group in the development process to improve social acceptance and achieve a population health impact.","2022-06-28","2023-01-17 12:05:13","2023-01-17 12:05:42","","e31921","","6","24","","J Med Internet Res","What are Digital Public Health Interventions?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35763320 PMCID: PMC9277526","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\7CUKFH3C\Wienert et al. - 2022 - What are Digital Public Health Interventions Firs.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35763320","","Humans; Public Health; Delivery of Health Care; Research Design; digital health; digital health technologies; digital Public Health; digital public health interventions; eHealth; framework; mHealth; mobile phone; participatory approach; Biomedical Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A systematic review","Health Research Policy and Systems","","1478-4505","10.1186/s12961-017-0247-z","","BACKGROUND: In order to understand and measure the policy impact of research we need a definition of research impact that is suited to the task. This article systematically reviewed both peer-reviewed and grey literature for definitions of research impact to develop a definition of research impact that can be used to investigate how public health research influences policy. METHOD: Keyword searches of the electronic databases Web of Science, ProQuest, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Informit, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and Google Scholar were conducted between August 2015 and April 2016. Keywords included 'definition' and 'policy' and 'research impact' or 'research evidence'. The search terms 'health', public health' or 'mental health' and 'knowledge transfer' or 'research translation' were used to focus the search on relevant health discipline approaches. Studies included in the review described processes, theories or frameworks associated with public health, health services or mental health policy. RESULTS: We identified 108 definitions in 83 publications. The key findings were that literature on research impact is growing, but only 23% of peer-reviewed publications on the topic explicitly defined the term and that the majority (76%) of definitions were derived from research organisations and funding institutions. We identified four main types of definition, namely (1) definitions that conceptualise research impacts in terms of positive changes or effects that evidence can bring about when transferred into policies (example Research Excellence Framework definition), (2) definitions that interpret research impacts as measurable outcomes (Research Councils UK), and (3) bibliometric and (4) use-based definitions. We identified four constructs underpinning these definitions that related to concepts of contribution, change, avenues and levels of impact. CONCLUSION: The dominance of bureaucratic definitions, the tendency to discuss but not define the concept of research impact, and the heterogeneity of definitions confirm the need for conceptual clarity in this area. We propose a working definition of research impact that can be used in a range of health policy contexts.","2017-10-02","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 23:16:04","","84","","1","15","","Health Res Policy Syst","How do we define the policy impact of public health research?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28969650 PMCID: PMC5625646","","; ; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\LVQK6INL\display.html; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\RDY7GLER\Alla et al. - 2017 - How do we define the policy impact of public healt.pdf","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=125443616&lang=fr&site=ehost-live&scope=cite; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28969650","","Humans; Public Health; Health Policy; Human; Policy; Research; Definitions; Evidence-informed policies; Health Services; Peer Review; Policy impact; Research impact; Serial Publications; Systematic Review; Peer Review, Health Care","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A review of concepts outlined in selected articles on population health and clinical epidemiology and a systematic literature search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of therapeutic interventions for cardiovascular disease that contained analysis of outcomes by socioeconomic status. RESULTS: Population health has a focus on health disparities, particularly disparities related to socioeconomic status, and many of its proponents have a pessimistic view of the degree to which health care can reduce these disparities. Clinical epidemiology has a focus on the production of valid evidence on the impact of health care interventions; however, RCTs rarely report the impact of interventions across socioeconomic strata. Both population health and clinical epidemiology share the view that efficacy, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness are all important in defining the impact of health care on health disparities. CONCLUSION: Principles drawn from both population health and clinical epidemiology could be used to provide a clearer picture of the role that health care interventions can have on socioeconomic disparities in health and to identify implications for policy, research, and clinical practice.","2005-08","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 12:05:37","","757-762","","8","58","","J Clin Epidemiol","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16018910","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16018910","","Humans; Social Justice; Health Policy; Epidemiologic Methods; Health Status; Socioeconomic Factors; Poverty; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet there is not sufficient empirical research around medical travel. People typically call all medical travelers ""medical tourists,"" a practice that is not helpful. Therefore, from a public health perspective, it is important to understand the definition of medical travel, the motivations behind travel, and how to overcome public health challenges that may occur as a result of this practice. Since medical travel is an experience that does not finish with obtaining health services, it is important to gather medical travelers' profiles before and after they access healthcare services. This will allow healthcare professionals to follow medical travelers' outcomes and assess their health-related quality of life. A robust evidence base will promote better future decisions related to medical travel. Creating an evidence base for medical travel will support upstream policies and strategies aimed at regulating the medical travel market. © 2021 by IGI Global.

SARS-CoV-2 is an exposure agent recently added to the network of exposures that comprise the human exposome, i.e. the totality of all environmental exposures throughout one's lifetime. At the same time, the application of measures to tackle SARS-CoV-2 transmission leads to changes in the exposome components and in characteristics of urban environments that define the urban exposome, a complementary concept to the human exposome, which focuses on monitoring urban health. This work highlights the use of a comprehensive systems-based approach of the exposome for better capturing the population-wide and individual-level variability in SARS-CoV-2 spread and its associated urban and individual exposures towards improved guidance and response. Population characteristics, the built environment and spatiotemporal features of city infrastructure, as well as individual characteristics/parameters, socioeconomic status, occupation and biological susceptibility need to be simultaneously considered when deploying non-pharmacological public health measures. Integrating individual and population characteristics, as well as urban-specific parameters is the prerequisite in urban exposome studies. Applications of the exposome approach in cities/towns could facilitate assessment of health disparities and better identification of vulnerable populations, as framed by multiple environmental, urban design and planning co-exposures. Exposome-based applications in epidemics control and response include the implementation of exposomic tools that have been quite mature in non-communicable disease research, ranging from biomonitoring and surveillance to sensors and modeling. Therefore, the exposome can be a novel tool in risk assessment and management during epidemics and other major public health events. This is a unique opportunity for the research community to exploit the exposome concept and its tools in upgrading and further developing site-specific public health measures in cities.","2021-01","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 12:05:37","","106246","","","146","","Environ Int","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 33181410 PMCID: PMC7834142","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\KTCSGC6Q\Andrianou et al. - 2021 - Exposome-based public health interventions for inf.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33181410","","Humans; Public Health; COVID-19; SARS-CoV-2; Pandemics; Environmental Exposure; Urban Health; Cities; Communicable Diseases; Exposome; Interventions; Systems-based approach","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The principles on which VPH is based are deeply rooted in the biological, physical and social sciences, and are widely shared in agriculture, medicine and the environmental sciences. It involves not only veterinarians but also professionals from a host of other disciplines. VPH is dynamic in its scope and functions, and future perspectives are defined by the changing policy and priorities of the health and agriculture sectors. VPH continuously explores the horizons of public health needs for new opportunities in which veterinary medicine has a comparative advantage. The control and eradication of zoonoses and food protection remain the prominent functions of VPH. In the region of the Americas, VPH forms one of the central approaches in the strategic orientation and programme priorities of the health sector, having three strategic foci: the elimination of urban rabies, the eradication of foot and mouth disease, and food protection.

With support from the American Public Health Association (APHA) Public Health Nursing Section, a national Task Force, was formed in November 2012 to update the definition of public health nursing, using processes that reflected deliberative democratic principles. A yearlong process was employed that included a modified Delphi technique and various modes of engagement such as online discussion boards, questionnaires, and public comment to review. The resulting 2013 document consisted of a reaffirmation of the one-sentence 1996 definition, while updating supporting documentation to align with the current social, economic, political, and health care context. The 2013 document was strongly endorsed by vote of the APHA Public Health Nursing Section elected leadership.

Thus, explaining public health policy of the past purely in medical or epidemiological terms ignores evidence that it was rarely, if ever, designed solely on medical grounds at the time.","2007-12","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 23:10:36","","87-92","","2","33","","Med Humanit","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23674428","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23674428","","public health; colonialism; infectious disease; law; Medical history; nationalism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, common understanding of public health emergency preparedness across EU/EEA countries is challenging, because preparedness is a relatively new field of activity and is inherently fraught with uncertainty. A set of practical, widely accepted and easy to use recommendations for generic preparedness that bundles the activities described in separate guidance documents supports countries in preparing for any possible health threat. The aim of this consensus procedure was to identify and seek consensus from national-level preparedness experts from EU/EEA countries on key recommendations of public health emergency preparedness. METHODS: To identify key recommendations and to prioritize the recommendations we started with a literature consensus procedure, followed by a modified Delphi method for consultation of public health emergency preparedness leaders of EU/EEA countries. This consisted of six consecutive steps: a questionnaire to achieve consensus on a core set of recommendations, a face-to-face consultation, preselection of prioritized recommendations, a questionnaire to achieve consensus on the prioritized set and a face-to-face consensus meeting to further prioritize recommendations. RESULTS: As a result, EU/EEA experts selected 149 recommendations as core preparedness principles and prioritized 42. The recommendations were grouped in the seven domains: governance (57), capacity building and maintenance (11), surveillance (19), risk-assessment (16), risk- and crisis management (35), post-event evaluation (6) and implementation of lessons learned (5). CONCLUSIONS: This prioritised set of consensus principles can provide a foundation for countries aiming to evaluate and improve their preparedness for public health emergencies. The recommendations are practical, support generic preparedness planning, and can be used by all countries irrespective of their current level of preparedness.","2020-10-01","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 23:09:58","","1482","","1","20","","BMC Public Health","Towards defining core principles of public health emergency preparedness","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32998729 PMCID: PMC7527265","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\LHBB4HNY\Belfroid et al. - 2020 - Towards defining core principles of public health .pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32998729","","Humans; Europe; Public Health; Referral and Consultation; Civil Defense; Disease Outbreaks; Consensus; Disaster Planning; Guidance; Infectious disease; Outbreak; Preparedness; Public health emergencies; Recommendation; European Union","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The role of health is a vital aspect of every emergency event whether it is caused by a naturally occurring hazard (hurricane, earthquake), an industrial accident or a biological hazard. The inclusion of humans in the fall-out of the disaster will often lead to health related impacts. Whilst the initial disaster might not have obvious public health impacts, the complexity and multifaceted drivers of each disaster can often lead to detrimental impacts on public health either at local, regional, national or international levels. This chapter explores some of the common features of a public health emergency and their interaction with a wider hazard-based landscape and argue that public health is a core function of emergency management, disaster risk reduction and disaster risk management. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2022.","2022","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 23:16:40","","72-89","","","","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Academic communities are divided regarding terminology and definitions, and what the scope, parameters and goals of precision public health should include. This protocol summarises the procedure for a scoping review which aims to identify and describe definitions, terminology, uses of the term and concepts in current literature. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A scoping review will be undertaken to gather existing literature on precision public health. We will search CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar, and include all documents published in English that mention precision public health. A critical discourse analysis of the resulting papers will generate an account of precision public health terminology, definitions and uses of the term and the use and meaning of language. The analysis will occur in stages: first, descriptive information will be extracted and descriptive statistics will be calculated in order to characterise the literature. Second, occurrences of the phrase 'precision public health' and alternative terms in documents will be enumerated and mapped, and definitions collected. The third stage of discourse analysis will involve analysis and interpretation of the meaning of precision public health, including the composition, organisation and function of discourses. Finally, discourse analysis of alternative phrases to precision public health will be undertaken. This will include analysis and interpretation of what alternative phrases to precision public health are used to mean, how the phrases relate to each other and how they are compared or contrasted to precision public health. Results will be grouped under headings according to how they answer the research questions. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: No ethical approval will be required for the scoping review. Results of the scoping review will be used as part of a doctoral thesis, and may be published in journals, conference proceedings or elsewhere.","2022-02-23","2023-01-17 12:05:37","2023-01-17 23:15:46","","e058069","","2","12","","BMJ Open","Mapping precision public health definitions, terminology and applications","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35197357 PMCID: PMC8867336","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\NSI4JADI\Bosward et al. - 2022 - Mapping precision public health definitions, termi.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35197357","","Humans; Publications; Public Health; public health; Review Literature as Topic; Research Design; qualitative research; statistics & research methods; Population Groups","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A qualitative analysis","BMC medical education","","1472-6920","10.1186/s12909-022-03590-6","","BACKGROUND: In 2019 a new Lifestyle Medicine (LM) module was introduced to the undergraduate medical curriculum at Imperial College London. Lifestyle Medicine is an emergent discipline which aims to tackle the increasing burden of non-communicable disease. Previous work has suggested that students value clinical teaching over traditional Public Health topics. Taking a constructivist view of learning, this paper assesses changes in medical students' attitudes towards Public Health and LM in response to living through a pandemic. We then make suggestions as to how this lived experience might be useful in teaching LM, and discuss the interaction between teaching, behaviour, and experience with consideration of self-determination theories in learning. METHODS: First-year medical students were surveyed at the end of their first year of teaching and asked if living during the COVID-19 pandemic had changed the value they place on LM and if so, how. Thematic analysis was conducted on responses representing 71% (n = 216) of the year group. RESULTS: Four themes were defined in the data: acknowledging importance; impact on behaviour; health inequalities and the wider determinants; and promoting Public Health and prevention. These themes highlight the distinct levels through which the pandemic has had an impact: from personal behaviour to population health. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to look at the impact of living through a pandemic on attitudes to LM. Our results suggest that the pandemic has led to increased reflection on health behaviours. The lived-experience of COVID-19 may facilitate a better understanding of health inequalities and their impact, alongside the opportunities presented by effective LM interventions.","2022-07-08","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","532","","1","22","","BMC Med Educ","Teaching and learning lifestyle medicine during COVID-19","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35804335 PMCID: PMC9270827","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\86HINTLQ\Harvey et al. - 2022 - Teaching and learning lifestyle medicine during CO.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35804335","","Humans; Public Health; COVID-19; Pandemics; Population Health; Life Style; Attitudes; Constructivism; Health Behaviours; Lifestyle Medicine; Pandemic; Self Care; Self-care; Students, Medical","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linear models describing knowledge transfer and translation have moved towards multi-directional and complexity-attuned approaches where knowledge is produced and becomes meaningful through social processes. There are calls for systems approaches to KM but little guidance on how this can be operationalised. This paper describes the contribution that systems thinking can make to KM and provides guidance about how to put it into action. Methods: We apply a model of systems thinking (which focuses on leveraging change in complex systems) to eight KM practices empirically identified by others. We describe how these models interact and draw out some key learnings for applying systems thinking practically to KM in public health policy and practice. Examples of empirical studies, tools and targeted strategies are provided. Findings: Systems thinking can enhance and fundamentally transform KM. It upholds a pluralistic view of knowledge as informed by multiple parts of the system and reconstituted through use. Mobilisation is conceived as a situated, non-prescriptive and potentially destabilising practice, no longer conceptualised as a discrete piece of work within wider efforts to strengthen public health but as integral to and in continual dialogue with those efforts. A systems approach to KM relies on contextual understanding, collaborative practices, addressing power imbalances and adaptive learning that responds to changing interactions between mobilisation activities and context. Conclusion: Systems thinking offers valuable perspectives, tools and strategies to better understand complex problems in their settings and for strengthening KM practice. We make four suggestions for further developing empirical evidence and debate about how systems thinking can enhance our capacity to mobilise knowledge for solving complex problems – (1) be specific about what is meant by ‘systems thinking’, (2) describe counterfactual KM scenarios so the added value of systems thinking is clearer, (3) widen conceptualisations of impact when evaluating KM, and (4) use methods that can track how and where knowledge is mobilised in complex systems. © 2020, The Author(s).","2020","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","","","1","18","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\MKMU7KBM\Haynes et al. - 2020 - Applying systems thinking to knowledge mobilisatio.pdf","","","Public health; Systems thinking; Knowledge mobilisation; Policy-making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With greater appreciation of the nature of oral health and disease, and of their determinants has come recognition of the need for wider public health action if the effects of prevention and oral health promotion are to be maximized.","2001-07","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","99-102","","3","8","","Prim Dent Care","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11490706","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11490706","","Humans; United Kingdom; Delivery of Health Care; Health Promotion; Evidence-Based Medicine; Prevalence; Public Health Dentistry; Quality of Life; Dental Caries; Fluoridation; Fluorosis, Dental; Oral Health; Tooth Erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design: Cross-sectional survey requiring quantitative and qualitative responses representing the first round of a consensus development Delphi technique. Setting: International. Subjects: Expert panel of 24 public health nutrition leaders from nine countries in the European Union, the USA and Australia. Results: All but one of the panel agreed it was important to have a consensus definition for public health nutrition to describe the field consistently. Opinion about the length and complexity of this definition tended to vary depending on the intended use of the definition. The large majority (18/24) supported the inclusion of specific reference to physical activity in a definition of public health nutrition, although there was not consensus (>83% agreement as criterion) on this point. Consensus descriptors regarded as important in a definition of public health nutrition included: population-based, focus on health promotion, food and nutrition systems focus, wellness maintenance, primary prevention, applies public health principles, education, environmental and political descriptors. Treatment as a descriptor was rated as unimportant by a majority (14/24) of panellists, delineating public health nutrition from clinical practice. Conclusions: There is strong international agreement amongst public health nutrition leaders in Europe, the USA and Australia about a range of descriptors that can be used to define public health nutrition. The limitations of using word-for-word definitions between and within countries may be overcome by explicit use of the consensus descriptors identified in this process.","2003","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","615-620","","6","6","","","Definitions for public health nutrition","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\IZ4TLV4B\Hughes - 2003 - Definitions for public health nutrition A develop.pdf","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=106728055&lang=fr&site=ehost-live&scope=cite","","Public Health; Human; United States; Health Promotion; Delphi Technique; Definition; Nomenclature; European Union; Australia; Community Health Services; Consensus development; Cross Sectional Studies; Descriptive Statistics; Dietitian Attitudes; Expert Clinicians; Job Description -- Classification; Nutrition; Nutrition Education; Physical Activity; Preventive Health Care; Public health nutrition; Qualitative Studies; Quantitative Studies; Questionnaires; Wellness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design Thinking, a user-driven process for problem-defining and solution-finding, not only has utility in the field of public health but stands as a potential mechanism for developing critical skills -such as empathy, creativity and innovation- amongst future professionals. Though the literature reflects the use of DT across many health sciences disciplines, less research has been published on how students apply learned concepts using real-world challenges of their choice and what difficulties they face during the process. Methods: This case study evaluates achieved learning outcomes after the introduction of a design thinking block into post-graduate public health curriculum at the University College Dublin. Two independent assessors evaluated student learning outcomes and observed difficulties during the process by assessing group presentations to identify and understand any learning difficulties using an ad-hoc designed tool. The tool consisted of twelve items scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Student feedback, in the form of an online survey, was also analysed to determine their level of enjoyment, perceived learning outcomes and opinions on the course content. Results: The assessors evaluated thirteen DT group presentations and reports from 50 students. The groups chose a range of topics from socialization of college students during Covid-19 to mental health challenges in a low-income country. Independent assessment of assignments revealed that the highest scores were reached by groups who explored a challenge relevant to their own lives (more than 80% of total possible points versus 60% class average). The groups that explored challenges more distant to themselves struggled with problem finding with a mean score of 2.05 (SD ± 1.2) out of 5 in that domain. The greatest difficulties were observed in problem finding and ideation. Though most students found the design thinking block enjoyable and relevant to their education, they recommended that the DT block be a stand-alone module. Students recognized that groups who chose a familiar topic experienced fewer difficulties throughout the process. Conclusion: The study showed that DT learning outcomes were best achieved when students focused on challenges, they had either personally experienced or were familiar with. These findings provide insight for future iterations of DT workshops and support the teaching of user-centred approaches to future public health practitioners. © 2022, The Author(s).","2022","2023-01-17 12:05:29","2023-01-17 12:05:29","","","","1","22","","","Teaching design thinking as a tool to address complex public health challenges in public health students","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\K2M6PEPH\Ingram et al. - 2022 - Teaching design thinking as a tool to address comp.pdf","","","Public health; Design thinking; Human-centred design; Learning outcomes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this growing interest in digital technologies in public health has not been accompanied by a clarity of scope to guide policy, practice, and research in this rapidly emergent field. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review seeks to determine the scope of digital health as described by public health researchers and practitioners and to consolidate a conceptual framework of digital public health. METHODS: The review follows Arksey and O'Malley's framework for conducting scoping reviews with improvements as suggested by Levac et al. The search strategy will be applied to Embase, Medline, and Google Scholar. A grey literature search will be conducted on intergovernmental agency websites and country-specific websites. Titles and abstracts will be reviewed by independent reviewers, while full-text reviews will be conducted by 2 reviewers to determine eligibility based on prespecified inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data will be coded in an iterative approach using the best-fit framework analysis methodology. RESULTS: This research project received funding from the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control Foundation for Population and Public Health on January 1, 2020. The initial search was conducted on June 1, 2020 and returned 6953 articles in total. After deduplication, 4523 abstracts were reviewed, and 227 articles have been included in the review. Ethical approval is not required for this review as it uses publicly available data. CONCLUSIONS: We anticipate that the findings of the scoping review will contribute relevant evidence to health policy makers and public health practitioners involved in planning, funding, and delivering health services that leverage digital technologies. Results of the review will be strategically disseminated through publications in scientific journals, conferences, and engagement with relevant stakeholders.

However, as yet, there appears to be a lack of conceptual clarity and consensus on its definition. OBJECTIVE: In this scoping review, we seek to assess formal and informal definitions of digital public health in the literature and to understand how these definitions have been conceptualized in relation to digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation. METHODS: We conducted a scoping literature search in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Google Scholar, and 14 government and intergovernmental agency websites encompassing 6 geographic regions. Among a total of 409 full articles identified, we reviewed 11 publications that either formally defined digital public health or informally described the integration of digital technologies into public health in relation to digitization, digitalization, and digital transformation, and we conducted a thematic analysis of the identified definitions. RESULTS: Two explicit definitions of digital public health were identified, each with divergent meanings. The first definition suggested digital public health was a reimagination of public health using new ways of working, blending established public health wisdom with new digital concepts and tools. The second definition highlighted digital public health as an asset to achieve existing public health goals. In relation to public health, digitization was used to refer to the technical process of converting analog records to digital data, digitalization referred to the integration of digital technologies into public health operations, and digital transformation was used to describe a cultural shift that pervasively integrates digital technologies and reorganizes services on the basis of the health needs of the public. CONCLUSIONS: The definition of digital public health remains contested in the literature. Public health researchers and practitioners need to clarify these conceptual definitions to harness opportunities to integrate digital technologies into public health in a way that maximizes their potential to improve public health outcomes.

Population-based contracting involves capitated risk taken across an entire population, such that any included services within the contract are paid for by the risk-bearing entity throughout the term of the agreement. Under such contracts, a risk-bearing entity, which may be a provider group, a hospital or another payer, administers the contract and assumes risk for contractually defined services. These contracts can be structured in various ways, from professional fee capitation to full global per member per month diagnosis-based risk. The entity contracting with the payer must have downstream network contracts to provide the care and facilities that it has agreed to provide. Population health is a very powerful model to reduce waste and costs. It requires a deep understanding of the nuances of such contracting and the appropriate infrastructure to manage both networks and risk.

However, the boundaries of public health within the healthcare system are indistinct. The current challenges to public health and healthcare require a closer collaboration between public and curative healthcare. This article presents public health services to define public health within the healthcare system. In accordance with international examples, we describe those services in terms of core functions and a new definition. Public health aims at promoting health and reducing inequalities in health, through the organized efforts of society. Based on this aim, the aim and ten core functions for the Dutch health care system are defined. The core functions go beyond institutional and professional boundaries; they can be executed by various sectors within and outside the healthcare system. Core functions can be translated into competencies and learning objectives for professionals in the public and curative healthcare sector. The proposed aim and core functions of public health services in the Netherlands are supportive to the required collaboration between public health and healthcare, and to the development of the corresponding medical educational programmes.","2014","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","","","2","158","","","De Nederlandse publieke gezondheidszorg: 10 kerntaken en een nieuwe definitie","","","","","","","Dutch","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\QFDVZT6W\display.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several frameworks exist to conceptualise healthcare systems, highlighting the stark contrast of frameworks unique to public health systems. The objectives of this study were to define public health systems and assess differences between healthcare systems and public health systems within established health systems frameworks. METHODS: A critical interpretive synthesis was conducted. Databases searched included EBSCOhost, OVID, Scholars Portal, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and Health Systems Evidence. Data extraction, coding and analysis followed a best-fit framework analysis method. Initial codes were based on a current leading health systems and policy classification scheme - health systems arrangements (governance, financial and delivery arrangements). RESULTS: A total of 5933 unique documents were identified and 67 were included in the analysis. Definitions of public health and public health systems varied significantly as did their roles and functions across jurisdictions. Public health systems arrangements generally followed those of health systems, with the addition of partnerships (community and inter-sectoral) and communication playing a larger role in public health. A public health systems framework and conceptualisation of how public health currently fits within health systems are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Public health systems are unique and vital entities within health systems. In addition to examining how public health and public health systems have been defined within the literature, this review suggests that establishing the scope of public health is crucial to understanding its role within the larger health system and adds to the discourse around the relationship between public health, healthcare and population health. More broadly, this study addresses an important gap in understanding public health systems and provides conceptual and practical contributions as well as areas for future research.","2020-06-16","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 23:17:38","","68","","1","18","","Health Res Policy Syst","Defining and classifying public health systems","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32546163 PMCID: PMC7296190","","; ; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\L7IUWY2U\Jarvis et al. - 2020 - Defining and classifying public health systems a .pdf","https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=ccm&AN=143801571&lang=fr&site=ehost-live&scope=cite; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32546163","","Public Health; Public health; Delivery of Health Care; Population health; Health systems; Health Care Delivery; Health services; Public Health -- Classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Design thinking is a consultative process involving multiple stakeholders and has been identified as a promising solution to create and apply implementation strategies in complex environments like health systems. Methods: We conducted a process evaluation of a real-world example, namely an initiative to innovate hypertension screening, diagnosis and care in São Paulo, Brazil. The parameters of the evaluation were informed by a specification rubric and categorization system, recommended for the investigation of implementation strategies, and the double-diamond conceptual framework to describe and examine the strategic architecture and nature of the design thinking approach, with particular emphasis on identifying potential areas of “value-add” particular to the approach. The retrospective evaluation was performed by an independent partner who had not been involved in the setting up and implementation of the design thinking process. Results: The evaluation unveiled a dense catalogue of strategically driven, mostly theoretically based, activities involving all identified health system stakeholders including patients. Narrative reconstruction illuminated the systematic and coherent nature of this approach, with different resulting actions progressively accounting for all relevant layers of the health system to engineer a broad selection of specific implementation solutions. The relevance of the identified features and the mechanics used to promote more successful implementation practices was manifested in several distinct ways: design thinking offered a clear direction on which innovations really mattered and when, as well as several new dimensions for consideration in the development of an innovation mindset amongst stakeholders. It thereby promoted relationship quality in terms of familiarity and trust, and commitment to evidence-based enquiry and action. Design thinking was also able to navigate the territory between the need for intervention “fidelity” versus “adaptation” and provide the operational know-how to face familiar implementation hurdles. Lastly, it brought a new kind of skill set to the public health stakeholders that incorporated diplomacy, multidisciplinary approaches and management sciences—skills that are considered necessary but not yet widely taught as part of public health training. Conclusions: Design thinking is a sound and viable tool to use as part of an implementation strategy for engaging with health system stakeholders and successfully translating evidence-based practices and new innovations into routine practice, thereby addressing an important knowledge—practice gap and, more broadly, contributing to the strategic repertoire available to implementation science. © 2022, The Author(s).","2022","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","","","1","20","","","","","","","","","","English","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\57WGXXWX\Jarrett et al. - 2022 - Deconstructing design thinking as a tool for the i.pdf","","","Health systems; Design thinking; Cardiovascular disease; Global health initiatives; Hypertension; Implementation science; Innovation; Process evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Public health surveillance is central to modern public health practice by contributing data and information usually through a national notifiable disease reporting system (NNDRS). Although early identification and prediction of future disease trends may be technically feasible, more work is needed to improve accuracy so that policy makers can use these predictions to guide prevention and control efforts. In this article, we review the advantages and limitations of the current NNDRS in most countries, discuss some lessons learned about prevention and control from the first wave of COVID-19, and describe some technological innovations in public health surveillance, including geographic information systems (GIS), spatial modeling, artificial intelligence, information technology, data science, and the digital twin method. We conclude that the technology-driven innovative public health surveillance systems are expected to further improve the timeliness, completeness, and accuracy of case reporting during outbreaks and also enhance feedback and transparency, whereby all stakeholders should receive actionable information on control and be able to limit disease risk earlier than ever before.

Practice guidelines set standards for disease identification and treatment. Quality care is often defined as adherence to these guidelines. Over the past few years, the diagnostic thresholds for several common medical conditions have been lowered, resulting in a substantial expansion in the market for health care. The most recent guidelines for high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and impaired fasting glucose each define a high percentage of the adult population as in need of regular medical attention. Under the latest proposed thresholds, virtually the entire adult population qualifies for a chronic condition diagnosis. We evaluate the health and financial outcomes associated with changes in diagnostic thresholds for the prevention of three risk factors for cardiovascular disease and stroke: blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and fasting plasma glucose.

The contextual differences between high- and low- and middle-income countries, and the process of globalization need to be taken into account while developing any global public health course. Global public health and public health are not separable and global public health often appears as an extension of public health in the era of globalization and interdependence. Though global public health is readily understood as health of global population, it is mainly practiced as health problems and their solutions set within low- and middle-income countries. Additional specialist competencies relevant to the context of low- and middle-income countries are needed to work in this field.

This implication is compounded by sequential, societal trends in which first dietary fat and then dietary carbohydrate were vilified during recent decades, leaving dietary protein under an implied halo. The popular concept that protein is ""good"" and that the more the better, coupled with a protein quality definition that favors meat, fosters the impression that eating more meat, as well as eggs and dairy, is desirable and preferable. This message, however, is directly opposed to current Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which encourage consumption of more plant foods and less meat, and at odds with the literature on the environmental impacts of foods, from carbon emissions to water utilization, which decisively favor plant protein sources. Thus, the message conveyed by the current definitions of protein quality is at odds with imperatives of public and planetary health alike. We review the relevant literature in this context and make the case that the definition of protein quality is both misleading and antiquated. We propose a modernized definition that incorporates the quality of health and environmental outcomes associated with specific food sources of protein. We demonstrate how such an approach can be adapted into a metric and applied to the food supply.","2019-09-01","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","755-764","","5","10","","Adv Nutr","Perspective","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 31066877 PMCID: PMC6743844","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\LQIYMC77\Katz et al. - 2019 - Perspective The Public Health Case for Modernizin.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31066877","","Humans; Public Health; Social Change; Diet; diet quality; dietary guidelines; dietary protein; Dietary Proteins; Feeding Behavior; nutrition policy; Nutrition Policy; protein quality; sustainability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is debate, sometimes heated, about whether population health and public health are identical or different. Discussions of population health involve many terms, such as outcomes, disparities, determinants, and risk factors, which may be used imprecisely, particularly across different disciplines, such as medicine, epidemiology, economics, and sociology. Nonetheless, thinking and communicating clearly about population health concepts are essential for public and private policymakers to improve the population's health and reduce disparities.

As other countries, Germany faces difficulties in adequately including hard-to-survey populations like PMB into national public health monitoring. The IMIRA project was initiated to develop strategies to adequately include PMB into public health monitoring and to represent diversity in public health reporting. Here, we aim to synthesize the lessons learned for diversity-oriented public health monitoring and reporting in Germany. We also aim to derive recommendations for further research on migration and health. We conducted two feasibility studies (interview and examination surveys) to improve the inclusion of PMB. Study materials were developed in focus groups with PMB. A systematic review investigated the usability of the concept of acculturation. A scoping review was conducted on discrimination as a health determinant. Furthermore, core indicators were defined for public health reporting on PMB. The translated questionnaires were well accepted among the different migrant groups. Home visits increased the participation of hard-to-survey populations. In examination surveys, multilingual explanation videos and video-interpretation services were effective. Instead of using the concept of acculturation, we derived several dimensions to capture the effects of migration status on health, which were more differentiated. We also developed an instrument to measure subjectively perceived discrimination. For future public health reporting, a set of 25 core indicators was defined to report on the health of PMB. A diversity-oriented public health monitoring should include the following: (1) multilingual, diversity-sensitive materials, and tools; (2) different modes of administration; (3) diversity-sensitive concepts; (4) increase the participation of PMB; and (5) continuous public health reporting, including constant reflection and development of concepts and methods.","2022-01-12","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","798","","2","19","","Int J Environ Res Public Health","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 35055619 PMCID: PMC8775825","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\UNZBTAVR\Koschollek et al. - 2022 - Results and Strategies for a Diversity-Oriented Pu.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35055619","","Humans; Public Health; Acculturation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Germany; core indicators; discrimination; diversity-oriented; Emigration and Immigration; migration; public health monitoring; public health reporting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Benefits and challenges of international public-private partnerships","Public Health","","1476-5616","10.1016/j.puhe.2017.03.005","","OBJECTIVE: In the last two decades international public-private partnerships have become increasingly important to improving public health in low- and middle-income countries. Governments realize that involving the private sector in projects for financing, innovation, development, and distribution can make a valuable contribution to overcoming major health challenges. Private-public partnerships for health can generate numerous benefits but may also raise some concerns. To guide best practice for public-private partnerships for health to maximize benefits and minimize risks, the first step is to identify potential benefits, challenges, and motives. We define motives as the reasons why private partners enter partnerships with a public partner. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of the literature using the PRISMA guidelines. METHOD: We reviewed the literature on the benefits and challenges of public-private partnerships for health in low- and middle-income countries provided by international pharmaceutical companies and other health-related companies. We provide a description of these benefits, challenges, as well as of motives of private partners to join partnerships. An approach of systematic categorization was used to conduct this research. RESULT: We identified six potential benefits, seven challenges, and three motives. Our main finding was a significant gap in the available academic literature on this subject. Further empirical research using both qualitative and quantitative approaches is required. From the limited information that is readily available, we conclude that public-private partnerships for health imply several benefits but with some noticeable and crucial limitations. CONCLUSION: In this article, we provide a description of these benefits and challenges, discuss key themes, and conclude that empirical research is required to determine the full extent of the challenges addressed in the literature.","2017-08","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","120-129","","","149","","Public Health","A means of improving public health in low- and middle-income countries?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 28595064","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28595064","","Humans; Developing Countries; International Cooperation; Public Health; Public health; Risk Assessment; Social Responsibility; Health Services Accessibility; Benefits; Challenges; Conflict of Interest; Humanitarian assistance; Motives; Pharmaceutical companies; Public-Private Sector Partnerships; Public–private partnerships","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet who and what defines and makes a population has everything to do with whether population means are meaningful or meaningless, with profound implications for work on population health and health inequities. METHODS: In this article, I review the current conventional definitions of, and historical debates over, the meaning(s) of ""population,"" trace back the contemporary emphasis on populations as statistical rather than substantive entities to Adolphe Quetelet's powerful astronomical metaphor, conceived in the 1830s, of l'homme moyen (the average man), and argue for an alternative definition of populations as relational beings. As informed by the ecosocial theory of disease distribution, I then analyze several case examples to explore the utility of critical population-informed thinking for research, knowledge, and policy involving population health and health inequities. FINDINGS: Four propositions emerge: (1) the meaningfulness of means depends on how meaningfully the populations are defined in relation to the inherent intrinsic and extrinsic dynamic generative relationships by which they are constituted; (2) structured chance drives population distributions of health and entails conceptualizing health and disease, including biomarkers, as embodied phenotype and health inequities as historically contingent; (3) persons included in population health research are study participants, and the casual equation of this term with ""study population"" should be avoided; and (4) the conventional cleavage of ""internal validity"" and ""generalizability"" is misleading, since a meaningful choice of study participants must be in relation to the range of exposures experienced (or not) in the real-world societies, that is, meaningful populations, of which they are a part. CONCLUSIONS: To improve conceptual clarity, causal inference, and action to promote health equity, population sciences need to expand and deepen their theorizing about who and what makes populations and their means.","2012-12","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 23:09:30","","634-681","","4","90","","Milbank Q","Who and what is a ""population""?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 23216426 PMCID: PMC3530737","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\THJ4DV92\Krieger - 2012 - Who and what is a population Historical debates.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23216426","","Humans; Public Health; Population Surveillance; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Public Health Practice; Evidence-Based Medicine; Terminology as Topic; Health Status Disparities; Population; History, 19th Century; Population Dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scientifically, however, this relationship is less readily detectable, particularly when the environment polluted by chemicals is the polluted human environment. It is more correct to define 'environment' to include both the 'external' and the 'local' environment. The external environment includes a part which is directly affected by man, for instance when man-made chemicals are involved as well as the natural environment. The local or personal environment particularly concerns matters which may be comprised in the term 'lifestyle'.

OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to review the literature and analyze data regarding the employment outcomes of public health graduate students and to examine how public health schools and programs might respond to changes in the sectors hiring their graduates. DESIGN: We reviewed the literature regarding the employment of public health graduates; analyzed 5 years of graduate outcomes from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health using logistic regression; and we examined data collected by the Association of Schools & Programs of Public Health. PARTICIPANTS: The study included data from surveys of 2904 graduates of Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, across 5 graduating cohort years, for whom there were employment sector data available for 1932. RESULTS: Much of the research on the public health workforce has defined it as governmental public health. Across each of 5 graduating classes from Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, the odds of for-profit sector employment increased by 23% (2012-2016), while hiring by government agencies declined or remained flat. Publicly available employment data from the Web sites of schools of public health and from surveys by the Association of Schools & Programs of Public Health show that hiring of new graduates by for-profit corporations now either closely matches or exceeds governmental hiring at many schools of public health. CONCLUSIONS: Public health graduates are increasingly working outside of government, and additional analyses are required to determine whether core competencies of public health curricula reflect the needs of the employers that are hiring public health graduates today. Schools and programs of public health should invest in their career services offices and gather input from employers that are currently hiring their graduates, especially as the sectors hiring them may be changing.","2021","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","12-19","","1","27","","J Public Health Manag Pract","The New Public Health Workforce","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 30925525","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30925525","","Humans; Public Health; Workforce; Health Workforce; Employment; Students","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data is spread across various settings, stored and managed in different systems. Due to the lack of technology interoperability and the large amounts of health-related data, data exploitation has not reached its full potential yet. AIM: The aim of the CrowdHEALTH approach, is to introduce a new paradigm of Holistic Health Records (HHRs) that include all health determinants defining health status by using big data management mechanisms. METHODS: HHRs are transformed into HHRs clusters capturing the clinical, social and human context with the aim to benefit from the collective knowledge. The presented approach integrates big data technologies, providing Data as a Service (DaaS) to healthcare professionals and policy makers towards a ""health in all policies"" approach. A toolkit, on top of the DaaS, providing mechanisms for causal and risk analysis, and for the compilation of predictions is developed. RESULTS: CrowdHEALTH platform is based on three main pillars: Data & structures, Health analytics, and Policies. CONCLUSIONS: A holistic approach for capturing all health determinants in the proposed HHRs, while creating clusters of them to exploit collective knowledge with the aim of the provision of insight for different population segments according to different factors (e.g. location, occupation, medication status, emerging risks, etc) was presented. The aforementioned approach is under evaluation through different scenarios with heterogeneous data from multiple sources.","2019-12","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","369-373","","5","27","","Acta Inform Med","The CrowdHEALTH project and the Hollistic Health Records","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 32210506 PMCID: PMC7085312","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\ERMZVVB6\Kyriazis et al. - 2019 - The CrowdHEALTH project and the Hollistic Health R.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32210506","","Health Analytics; Holistic Health records; Public Health Policy Making","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"UTWZE6PD","journalArticle","2015","Lee, Lisa M.; Zarowsky, Christina","Foundational values for public health","Public Health Reviews","","0301-0422","10.1186/s40985-015-0004-1","","The development of an agreed-upon set of foundational ethical values for the field of public health is ongoing. In this paper we outline key elements of recent convergence on some basic moral precepts that drive public health. We suggest that three elements are particularly useful for anchoring public health practitioners' reflections on public health ethics: 1) the notions of ""common"" and ""professional"" morality, 2) an understanding of the practice and content of modern public health and especially its practical, solution-focused orientation, and 3) an appreciation of the history of public health as integrally linked to evolving and contested views of the relationship between citizens, science, and the state. There is broad agreement that governments are stewards of their populations and are responsible for providing conditions that allow for its members to be healthy and productive. Given the role of policy and government in public health, the role of political philosophy likely has a substantial place as we seek a coherent system of ethical justification in our work. The aim here is not to align with one theoretical approach or another, rather, to consider the foundational values of public health practice order to identify the common moral governance of our work. Our profession's morality-the set of norms shared by all public health professionals-is determined by what public health is and what we think it should be. As our aspirations for public health evolve, it is incumbent upon us to engage in reflective discourse to reach a new equilibrium about our moral foundation.","2015","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","2","","","36","","Public Health Rev","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 29450030 PMCID: PMC5809907","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\7HLU5CRN\Lee et Zarowsky - 2015 - Foundational values for public health.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29450030","","Public health; Ethics; Values","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For public health, the goal is applicability: to translate, disseminate, and implement EBIs for an impact on population health. This article is a review of methods and how they might be combined to better assess external validity. The methods include (a) better description of EBIs and their contexts; (b) combining of statistical tools and logic to draw inferences about study samples; (c) sharper definition of the theory behind the intervention and core intervention components; and (d) more systematic consultation of practitioners. For population impact, studies should focus on context features that are likely to be both important (based on program theory) and frequently encountered by practitioners.

First, dose-response relationships between weather parameters and many of the likely health effects have not been developed, and second, reliable estimates of future regional climates across the United States are still beyond the scope of current modeling efforts. Consequently, probabilistic risk estimates of most of the likely regional health impacts of GCC have such a high degree of uncertainty that their usefulness to health officials dealing with regional issues is very limited. With the numerous pressures on today's health care systems, it is understandable that the possible consequences of GCC have received scant attention from regional health care decision makers. Indeed, the consensus among this community appears to be that any increases in health effects associated with GCC will be easily handled by the current health care system. However, such a position may be naive as the potential exists that an unequal distribution of such effects could overwhelm some regions, whereas others may feel little or no impact. This review of the likely regional impacts of GCC has been structured as a semianalytical look at this issue of distributional effects. Because of the lack of dose-response information and reliable estimates of future regional climates, however, it takes a historical perspective. That is, it assumes that the quality and quantity of health risks a region faces under GCC will be directly related to its recent history of health risks from warm weather/climate-related diseases as well as to the size, characteristics, and distribution of the sensitive subpopulations currently residing within its borders. The approach is semiquantitative; however, it uses national data gathered on a regional level and as such should only be used to generate a hypothesis rather than test it. When applied to the United States, its outcome leads to the hypothesis that if indeed history repeats itself, some states or regions may be more greatly affected by GCC than others, not only because historically they are more prone to summer weather/climate-related diseases, but also because they contain a greater proportion of the sensitive subpopulations in the United States.","1999-02","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","169-179","","Suppl 1","107 Suppl 1","","Environ Health Perspect","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 10229716 PMCID: PMC1566351","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\MULYDXCD\Longstreth - 1999 - Public health consequences of global climate chang.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10229716","","Humans; Public Health; United States; Animals; Risk; Disease Susceptibility; Air Pollutants; Climate; Ozone","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To better understand these terms and better regulate such technologies, we need distinct definitions of health and medical apps. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to provide an overview of the definitions of health and medical apps from an interdisciplinary perspective. We summarized the core elements of the identified definitions for their holistic understanding in the context of digital public health. METHODS: The legal frameworks for medical device regulation in the United States, the European Union, and Germany formed the basis of this study. We then searched 6 databases for articles defining health or medical apps from an interdisciplinary perspective. The narrative literature review was supported by a forward and backward snowball search for more original definitions of health and medical apps. A qualitative analysis was conducted on the identified relevant aspects and core elements of each definition. On the basis of these findings, we developed a holistic definition of health and medical apps and created a decision flowchart to highlight the differences between the 2 types. RESULTS: The legal framework showed that medical apps could be regulated as mobile medical devices, whereas there is no legal term for health apps. Our narrative literature review identified 204 peer-reviewed publications that offered a definition of health and medical apps. After screening for original definitions and applying the snowball method, 11.8% (24/204) of the publications were included in the qualitative analysis. Of these 24 publications, 22 (88%) provided an original definition of health apps and 11 (44%) described medical apps. The literature suggests that medical apps are a part of health apps. To describe health or medical apps, most definitions used the user group, a description of health, the device, the legal regulation, collected data, or technological functions. However, the regulation should not be a distinction criterion as it requires legal knowledge, which is neither suitable nor practical. An app's intended medical or health use enables a clear differentiation between health and medical apps. Ultimately, the health aim of an app and its main target group are the only distinction criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Health apps are software programs on mobile devices that process health-related data on or for their users. They can be used by every health-conscious person to maintain, improve, or manage the health of an individual or the community. As an umbrella term, health apps include medical apps. Medical apps share the same technological functions and devices. Health professionals, patients, and family caregivers are the main user groups. Medical apps are intended for clinical and medical purposes and can be legally regulated as mobile medical devices.","2022-10-31","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","e37980","","10","10","","JMIR Mhealth Uhealth","The Definitions of Health Apps and Medical Apps From the Perspective of Public Health and Law","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36315221 PMCID: PMC9664324","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\V78TV6Q6\Maaß et al. - 2022 - The Definitions of Health Apps and Medical Apps Fr.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36315221","","Humans; Public Health; Health Personnel; United States; Data Collection; digital health; mobile phone; Computers, Handheld; DiGA; digital care applications; digital health applications; DiPA; health app; medical app; Mobile Applications; mobile health; mobile medical device; regulation; snowball search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Verbatim responses to the question ""What does the word community mean to you?"" were analyzed. Cluster analysis was used to identify similarities in the way community was described. A common definition of community emerged as a group of people with diverse characteristics who are linked by social ties, share common perspectives, and engage in joint action in geographical locations or settings. The participants differed in the emphasis they placed on particular elements of the definition. Community was defined similarly but experienced differently by people with diverse backgrounds. These results parallel similar social science findings and confirm the viability of a common definition for participatory public health.","2001-12","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 23:09:35","","1929-1938","","12","91","","Am J Public Health","What is community?","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11726368 PMCID: PMC1446907","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\2TWYUG42\MacQueen et al. - 2001 - What is community An evidence-based definition fo.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11726368","","Female; Humans; Health Care and Public Health; Public Health; United States; Male; Focus Groups; Evidence-Based Medicine; Interviews as Topic; Research Design; Residence Characteristics; Community-Institutional Relations; AIDS Vaccines; Empirical Approach; HIV Infections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In low- and middle- income countries, there are substantial complexities that affect the way in which research can be utilised for public health action. This review attempts to draw out concepts in the literature that contribute to defining some of the complexities and contextual factors that influence knowledge translation for public health in low- and middle- income countries. METHODS: A Critical Interpretive Synthesis was undertaken, a method of analysis which allows a critical review of a wide range of heterogeneous evidence, through incorporating systematic review methods with qualitative enquiry techniques. A search for peer-reviewed articles published between 2000 and 2016 on the topic of knowledge translation for public health in low- and middle - income countries was carried out, and 85 articles were reviewed and analysed using this method. RESULTS: Four main concepts were identified: 1) tension between 'global' and 'local' health research, 2) complexities in creating and accessing evidence, 3) contextualising knowledge translation strategies for low- and middle- income countries, and 4) the unique role of non-government organisations in the knowledge translation process.

The few traditional systematic reviews that have been done to identify best practice provide little direction for action. The concept of evidence-based practice has been adopted in health care, and in medicine in particular, to determine best practice. Evidence-based medicine has its origins in the scientific method and for many researchers this concept means strict adherence to standards determining internal validity in order to justify a practice as evidence based. Practitioners addressing population health face challenges in identifying criteria for determining evidence, in part because of the nature of population health with its goal of shifting the health of whole populations. As well, the type of evidence provided by more traditional critical appraisal schema is limiting. Expanded approaches in finding and defining evidence have been proposed that use: expert panels; broad and inclusive search and selection strategies; appraisal criteria that incorporate context and generalizability. A recent synthesis of 147 programmes addressing childhood overweight and obesity provides a concrete example of using a broader approach to identify evidence for best practice (Flynn et al. 2006). Incorporating evaluation and population health frameworks as criterion components in addition to traditional methodological rigour criteria, this synthesis has identified programmes that provide contextual information that can be used to populate what Swinburn et al. (2005) have described as the 'promise table'. Using this approach a range in 'certainty of effectiveness' and a range in 'potential for population impact' are integrated to identify promising strategies. The exercise can provide direction for agencies and practitioners in taking action to address obesity.","2006-11","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","403-411","","4","65","","Proc Nutr Soc","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 17181907","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\7UW74DB4\McNeil et Flynn - 2006 - Methods of defining best practice for population h.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17181907","","Female; Humans; Public Health; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Male; Health Promotion; Evidence-Based Medicine; Child Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Obesity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

X.; Stöhr, K.; Heymann, D.","Public health implications of emerging zoonoses","Revue Scientifique Et Technique (International Office of Epizootics)","","0253-1933","10.20506/rst.19.1.1214","","Many new, emerging and re-emerging diseases of humans are caused by pathogens which originate from animals or products of animal origin. A wide variety of animal species, both domestic and wild, act as reservoirs for these pathogens, which may be viruses, bacteria or parasites. Given the extensive distribution of the animal species affected, the effective surveillance, prevention and control of zoonotic diseases pose a significant challenge. The authors describe the direct and indirect implications for public health of emerging zoonoses. Direct implications are defined as the consequences for human health in terms of morbidity and mortality. Indirect implications are defined as the effect of the influence of emerging zoonotic disease on two groups of people, namely: health professionals and the general public. Professional assessment of the importance of these diseases influences public health practices and structures, the identification of themes for research and allocation of resources at both national and international levels. The perception of the general public regarding the risks involved considerably influences policy-making in the health field. Extensive outbreaks of zoonotic disease are not uncommon, especially as the disease is often not recognised as zoonotic at the outset and may spread undetected for some time. However, in many instances, the direct impact on health of these new, emerging or re-emerging zoonoses has been small compared to that of other infectious diseases affecting humans. To illustrate the tremendous indirect impact of emerging zoonotic diseases on public health policy and structures and on public perception of health risks, the authors provide a number of examples, including that of the Ebola virus, avian influenza, monkeypox and bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Recent epidemics of these diseases have served as a reminder of the existence of infectious diseases and of the capacity of these diseases to occur unexpectedly in new locations and animal species. The need for greater international co-operation, better local, regional and global networks for communicable disease surveillance and pandemic planning is also illustrated by these examples. These diseases have contributed to the definition of new paradigms, especially relating to food safety policies and more generally to the protection of public health. Finally, the examples described emphasise the importance of intersectorial collaboration for disease containment, and of independence of sectorial interests and transparency when managing certain health risks.","2000-04","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","310-317","","1","19","","Rev Sci Tech","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11189723","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11189723","","Humans; Global Health; International Cooperation; Public Health; Risk Factors; Disease Outbreaks; Animals; Morbidity; Zoonoses; Communicable Diseases, Emerging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The expansion of undergraduate public health programs provides a unique opportunity for more extensive training and education of the next generation of public health professionals and to center undergraduate public health education around the need to be competent in addressing health disparities to achieve health equity. Following national accreditation standards set by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH), undergraduate Bachelor of Public Health (BSPH) students at the University at Buffalo (UB) must complete a capstone course before graduation. This course focuses on integrating and synthesizing knowledge acquired from the BSPH core curriculum through analysis, explanation, and addressing public health problems via an interdisciplinary approach. We designed the most recent iterations of the capstone class based on the model that includes cross-cutting skills as defined by CEPH, evidence-based decision-making skills, established learning objectives of the course, and centering on health equity. This course also builds on the students' previously acquired knowledge with an ultimate goal to prepare the graduating seniors for the ""real world"" health equity-related public health activities. As a part of the coursework, students complete case studies, article reviews, and active learning group activities that target each component of the model. The final products of the course are a synthesis paper and oral presentation based on a public health problem as identified through surveillance data, analyzing causes of this problem, identifying critical stakeholders, creating an evidence-based solution to the problem, and explaining how health inequities may be addressed through the proposed solution. Centering the culminating course for BSPH undergraduate students on health equity will help ensure a competent and skilled workforce, informed by accreditation standards and prepared to lead our national public health goal of improved and equitable population health.","2022","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","992835","","","10","","Front Public Health","Modern public pealth problems and solutions","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 36276352 PMCID: PMC9580492","","; C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\ZWTIJEWZ\Minlikeeva et al. - 2022 - Modern public pealth problems and solutions An un.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36276352","","Humans; Public Health; Curriculum; Accreditation; Health Equity; public health workforce; Students; bachelor of science public health; capstone course; health equity; undergraduate public health education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The traditional ways that Public Health practitioners work may not capture such complex and dynamic change. To address this, Lambeth Council used future scenario thinking. Methods: A literature review looked at political, socioeconomic and other 'transitions' in the borough. Interviews, focus groups and workshops were held with CYP, parents, carers, local statutory and non-statutory stakeholders about the future for Lambeth CYP in the decade ahead. Themes were analysed to identify which had the potential for the biggest impact or the most uncertainty. Results: The main transitions were described, 100 stakeholders interviewed, and five 'drivers' of the future were identified: protracted austerity, technological explosion, demographic shift, 'democratic shake-up""and planetary health. From all these data, four future scenarios were developed: 'communities care for themselves', 'collaborating to care for all', 'nobody cares' and 'who cares?' Conclusions: New insights were gained about promoting more responsibility for, and active participation of CYP. This led to Lambeth's CYP Plan and the 'Made in Lambeth' campaign aiming to enlist the community and business in creating a child-friendly borough. © 2020 The Author(s).

METHODS: We estimated annualized arthritis prevalence in 2011-2012, among adults age ≥20 years, using 2 definition methods, both based on self-report: 1) doctor-/health care provider-diagnosed arthritis in the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS), National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), and Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS); and 2) three arthritis definitions based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) criteria in MEPS (National Arthritis Data Workgroup on Arthritis and Other Rheumatic Conditions [NADW-AORC], Clinical Classifications Software [CCS], and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]). RESULTS: Diagnosed arthritis prevalence percentages using the surveys were within 3 points of one another (BRFSS 26.2% [99% confidence interval (99% CI) 26.0-26.4], MEPS 26.1% [99% CI 25.0-27.2], NHIS 23.5% [99% CI 22.9-24.1], NHANES 23.0% [99% CI 19.2-26.8]), and those using ICD-9-CM were within 5 percentage points of one another (CCS 25.8% [99% CI 24.6-27.1]; CDC 28.3% [99% CI 27.0-29.6]; and NADW-AORC 30.7% [99% CI 29.4-32.1]). The variation in the estimated number (in millions) affected with diagnosed arthritis was 7.8 (BRFSS 58.5 [99% CI 58.1-59.1], MEPS 59.3 [99% CI 55.6-63.1], NHANES 51.5 [99% CI 37.2-65.5], and NHIS 52.6 [99% CI 50.9-54.4]), and using ICD-9-CM definitions it was 11.1 (CCS 58.7 [99% CI 54.5-62.9], CDC 64.3 [99% CI 59.9-68.6], and NADW 69.9 [99% CI 65.2-74.5]). Most (57-70%) reporting diagnosed arthritis also reported ICD-9-CM arthritis; respondents reporting diagnosed arthritis were older than those meeting ICD-9-CM definitions. Proxy response status affected arthritis prevalence differently across surveys. CONCLUSION: Public health practitioners and decision makers are frequently charged with choosing a single number to represent arthritis prevalence in the US population. We encourage them to consider the surveys' purpose, design, measurement methods, and statistical precision when choosing an estimate.","2017-03","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","356-367","","3","69","","Arthritis Care Res (Hoboken)","Defining Arthritis for Public Health Surveillance","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 27214851","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27214851","","Aged; Female; Humans; United States; Adult; Male; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Health Surveys; Prevalence; Reproducibility of Results; Young Adult; Age Distribution; Arthritis; Epidemiologic Research Design; International Classification of Diseases; Self Report; Sex Distribution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NICE also produces quality standards that set out what high-quality care in the NHS should look like, and support tools for providers and commissioners in the NHS and local authorities. From 2013, NICE will produce quality standards for social care, as part of its expanding remit. This manual describes the methods used by the Centre for Public Health Excellence (CPHE) in NICE to develop and update public health guidance. It is aimed at: External agencies undertaking evidence reviews and economic modelling for CPHE. Other contractors engaged in the guidance production process (for example, those conducting fieldwork). Members of NICE's public health advisory committees (PHACs) that develop public health guidance. Staff in CPHE and other NICE teams that contribute to the development and dissemination of public health guidance and related products. This third edition has been prepared by CPHE staff, drawing on experience of the first 7 years of public health guidance development at NICE. It is based on international criteria of quality for guidance development, as outlined by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. The structure of this manual follows the methods for development of NICE public health guidance from inception to publication. An overview of the processes for public health guidance development is described in The NICE public health guidance development process (third edition, 2012). The manuals define the philosophical and methodological principles that govern the production of guidance.

Preliminary evidence suggests that female sex, age, comorbidities, the severity of acute disease, and obesity are associated with Long COVID. Almost 50% of primary studies reported some degree of Long COVID-related social and family-life impairment, long absence periods off work, adjusted workloads, and loss of employment. Conclusion: Long COVID will likely have a substantial public health impact. Current evidence is still heterogeneous and incomplete.

K.","The public health consequences of disasters","Prehospital and Disaster Medicine","","1049-023X","","","Although disasters have exacted a heavy toll of death and suffering, the future seems more frightening. Good disaster management must link data collection and analysis to the decision-making process. The overall objectives of disaster management from the viewpoint of public health are: 1) needs assessments; 2) matching available resources with defined needs; 3) prevention of further adverse health effects; 4) implementation of disease-control strategies; 5) evaluation of the effectiveness of the application of these strategies; and 6) improvement in contingency planning for future disasters. The effects of sudden-onset, natural disasters on humans are quantifiable. Knowledge of the epidemiology of deaths, injuries, and illnesses is essential to determine effective responses; provide public education; establish priorities, planning, and training. In addition, the temporal patterns for the medical care required must be established so that the needs in future disasters can be anticipated. This article discusses: 1) the nature of disasters due to sudden-onset, natural events; 2) the medical and health needs associated with such events and disasters; 3) practical issues of disaster responses; and 4) the advance organization and management of disasters. The discussion also includes: 1) discussions of past problems in disaster management including non-congruence between available supplies and the actual needs of the affected population; 2) information management; 3) needs assessments; 4) public health surveillance; and 5) linking information with decision-making. This discussion is followed by an analysis of what currently is known about the health-care needs during some specific types of sudden-onset, natural disasters: 1) floods; 2) tropical cyclones; 3) tornadoes; 4) volcanic eruptions; and 5) earthquakes. The article concludes with descriptions of some specific public-health problems associated with disasters including epidemics and disposition of corpses. All natural disasters are unique in that the regions affected have different social, economic, and health backgrounds. But, many similarities exist, and knowledge about these can ensure that the health and emergency medical relief and limited resources are well-managed.","2000","2023-01-17 12:05:20","2023-01-17 12:05:20","","147-157","","4","15","","Prehosp Disaster Med","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11227602","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11227602","","Humans; Public Health Practice; Disasters; Disease Outbreaks; Health Services Needs and Demand; Disaster Planning; Information Systems; Relief Work","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Réseau thématique 19","La santé: du public à l'intime","","978-2-8109-0336-8","","","","La 4e de couverture indique : ""Dans la période contemporaine, plus que jamais, les expériences de la santé, de la maladie, de la vieillesse et du handicap se constituent à l’intersection des sphères privée et publique. D’un côté la santé publique « dé-privatise » les actes et les préoccupations de santé, de l’autre, les pratiques individuelles façonnent certains dispositifs institutionnels et/ou législatifs et en même temps se « dé-singularisent ». Les individus doivent à la fois se réapproprier le message institutionnel et être en capacité de donner à une expérience intime un caractère public. Si la sociologie de la santé s’est amplement développée depuis les années 1970, l’interface public-privé et la porosité de ses frontières a été peu interrogée. Les analyses de cet ouvrage apportent un nouveau regard sur ce qui circule entre les sphères privée et publique afin de rendre intelligibles les mécanismes sociaux qui sous-tendent cette interface. Comment s’opère le mouvement de dé-privatisation de la santé, selon quels ressorts, enjeux, limites ? Comment le privé s’immisce-t-il, façonne-t-il, imprègne-t-il la sphère publique de la santé ? En partant des situations empiriques les plus représentatives, cet ouvrage invite sociologues, étudiants, professionnels de santé, usagers et citoyens à porter leur attention sur l’articulation public/privé dans le champ de la santé.""","2015","2023-01-17 23:24:25","2023-01-18 19:53:09","","","159","","","","","La santé","","","","","Presses de l'École des hautes études en santé publique","Rennes, France","français","","","","","Library Catalog - www.sudoc.abes.fr","","ISSN: 1626-2654","","C:\Users\Papa ours\Zotero\storage\BCWNG4NE\SRCH.html; ; ","https://www.sudoc.fr/184303966; http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A904957974","Céline; Pas lu","Politique publique -- Acte de congrès; Politique sanitaire; Privatisation -- Acte de congrès; Sociologie de la santé; Sociologie médicale -- Acte de congrès","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Le premier décrit les moyens de la Santé publique : l'organisation sanitaire et sociale (système de santé, analyse des institutions sanitaires et sociales en France, démographie médicale, protection sociale), l'épidémiologie, les actions de Santé publique (planification, promotion, prévention, éducation sanitaire, évaluation). Le second étudie les secteurs clés dont deux occupent une place prépondérante : la prévention médicale et l'action médico-sociale en faveur des populations les plus vulnérables. Les secteurs environnement, toxicomanies, accidents, nutrition, pays en voie de développement font également l'objet d'une analyse","1995","2023-01-17 23:25:17","2023-01-18 19:50:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","Masson","Paris","fre","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 716374194","","","","Céline; Pas lu","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2e éd., 2e tir","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
